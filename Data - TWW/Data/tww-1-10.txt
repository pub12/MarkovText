TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NORTHWEST LOBBY - MORNING
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 23, 7:30 A.M.
A large, decorated Christmas tree stands in the middle of the lobby. Mandy and C.J. 
discuss the White House holiday celebration, while Toby stands around uninterested, 
reading a newspaper. Staffers are hurrying around decorating the lobby with plants, 
flags, lights, etc.

MANDY
The President will stand next to the tree with flag on the left and the carolers 
will be off to the side.

C.J. 
With the Santa hats on?

MANDY
No. Dickensian costumes.

C.J.
Nice.

MANDY
Maybe we’ll have both.

C.J.
You think?

MANDY
You think they’ll clash?

C.J.
Might.

TOBY
Someone tell me why I’m standing here.

C.J.
To weigh in on this.

TOBY
I could care less.

MANDY
Toby.

TOBY
More?

SAM
[walks up] Who’s playing Santa?

MANDY
Al Roker.

SAM
Playing Santa?

MANDY
What’s wrong with that?

SAM
Went on a diet.

TOBY
How do you know these things?

SAM
I read.

MANDY
We’ll pad them if we have to. Now, we have Jose Feliciano, we have Sammy Sosa and his wife...

SAM
Did you know that recordings of “Feliz Navidad” outsold recordings of “White Christmas?”

TOBY
What are you?

SAM
I am fully briefed.

MANDY
So he speaks.

TOBY
On what?

SAM
Pageant of peace, season of hope, coming of the new millennium.

TOBY
Coming of the new millennium?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
Fine.

SAM
Don’t start.

TOBY
I said fine.

MANDY
Would you two guys stop?

C.J.
Are we done?

MANDY
Yeah.

Mandy stays behind as C.J., Sam, and Toby start to walk through the HALLWAYS to their 
offices.

TOBY
It’s not the new millennium, but I’ll just let it drop.

SAM
It is.

TOBY
It is not the new millennium. The year 2000 is the last year of the millennium. It’s not 
the first one of the next.

SAM
But the common sensibility, to quote Steven J. Gould...

TOBY
Steven J. Gould needs to look at a calendar.

SAM
Gould says that this is a largely unreasonable issue. 

TOBY
Yes, it’s tough to resolve. Yes, you have to look at a calendar.

They walk through the Roosevelt Room where several other staffers are working, when 
Ginger calls him.

GINGER
Toby.

TOBY
What?

GINGER
Phone call.

TOBY
I’m arguing now, I’ll call them back.

GINGER
It’s the D.C. police.

C.J., Sam and Toby stop on their tracks, and turn to face Ginger.

TOBY
What do they want?

GINGER
They want you.

TOBY
Huh. [walks away]

Sam and C.J. as they walk out of the Roosevelt Room into another HALLWAY.

SAM
You got to ask yourself which is more exciting, watching your car roll over from 99,999 
to 100,000, or watching it go from 100 to 101?

C.J.
So technically the millennium is still a year away? 

SAM
Yeah, but we’ve made all these plans.

They pass by a Secret Service agent, DONNIE.

C.J.
Donnie, would you tell them I’m on my way over to see the President?

DONNIE
[into mike] Flamingo is on her way.

Sam turns the corner, but C.J. whips around when she hears what Donnie called her.

C.J.
Who? What did you call... what did he call me?

Sam reaches from off camera and pulls her away.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL - DAY
Early morning, we pan through the monuments, memorials, benches, and visitors. Toby approaches 
a police officer standing in front of a bench, where a man, covered with blankets, lies.

TOBY
Excuse me.

OFFICER
Yep.

TOBY
I’m Toby Zeigler.

OFFICER
Where you been?

TOBY
I was at the coroner’s office. They told me to come here.

The officer pulls back the blanket to reveal the face of the man. He’s dead.

OFFICER
Do you know this man?

Toby, uncomfortable, comes closer and looks at the man.

TOBY
No.

OFFICER
You sure?

TOBY
Yeah.

OFFICER
His last name is Hufnagle, if that rings a bell. 

TOBY
No.

OFFICER
He had a driver’s license on him, expired in 1973. Hufnagle, Walter.

TOBY
Why’d you call me?

OFFICER
He also had your business card.

TOBY
Did he?

OFFICER
You Toby Zeigler?

TOBY
Yeah.

OFFICER
From the White House?

TOBY
Yeah.

OFFICER
And he had your business card?

TOBY looks bewildered. Then after a moment a look of comprehension comes over his face.

TOBY
Well, that’s my coat. I gave that coat to the Goodwill. There must have been a... 

OFFICER
The card was in it... Well, that explains that. Well, thanks for your time.

TOBY
Yeah. [starts to leave, but turns] Listen, this isn’t a crime scene is it?

OFFICER
No, sir.

TOBY
See, I got the call an hour ago, I went to the coroner’s office. I’m just wondering why 
the body’s still here.

OFFICER
An ambulance will come by. It’s not a high priority. 

TOBY
And then you’re gonna call the V.A. right?

OFFICER
The V.A.?

TOBY
[points] Tattoo on his forearm is Marine Battalion Second of the Seventh. This guy 
was in Korea.

OFFICER
Huh... Thanks.

The officer covers the man with the blanket again. Toby looks slightly bothered by the 
officer’s casual attitude towards the deceased man.

TOBY
Yeah, thanks.

OFFICER
Merry Christmas.

TOBY
[almost to himself] Merry Christmas.

Toby walks away, pausing to look at the deceased veteran once more. His whole demeanor 
is troubled.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Donna approaches Josh in the very festively decorated bullpen, as several staffers are 
busy working around them.
 
DONNA
Good morning, Josh.

JOSH
Good morning Donna, and a Merry Christmas to you and your whole Protestant family.

DONNA
Thank you.

JOSH
As you can see I have not yet bought your Christmas present.

DONNA
Yes, and I know you’re agonizing over how to best express your appreciation and affection 
for me at this time of the year.

JOSH
That and how I scrape together the ten bucks.

DONNA
I’ve prepared a list. 

She gives him a small piece of paper as they continue to walk.

JOSH
Of Christmas gift suggestions?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
[reads] “Ski pants, ski boots, ski hat, ski goggles, ski gloves, ski poles.” I’m assuming 
you already have skis?

DONNA
Page two?

JOSH
Right.

They cut the corner into a HALLWAY.

DONNA
Just pick something off the list, and, you know, feel free to pick two things.

JOSH
I should feel that freedom?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Thanks.

DONNA
I want to learn how to ski.

JOSH
Why?

DONNA
I like the equipment.

JOSH
Okay.

DONNA
Where you going?

JOSH
I, uh, need to speak to Leo.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
He wants to talk about your Christmas present.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
So you’ll think about the skis?

JOSH
Yeah. I’ll give that a lot of thought.

Donna walks off. Josh waits until her back is turned before crumpling up her list and 
throwing into a wastebasket. Josh then enters MARGARET’S OFFICE. Nobody inside.

JOSH
Hello!

LEO [OS]
Come on back.

JOSH goes into LEO’S OFFICE. Leo is sitting in front of brightly wrapped Christmas 
presents in the table. Margaret is standing next to him with her clipboard. She is 
having trouble with her pen.

MARGARET
Good morning, Josh.

JOSH
This is quite an operation.

MARGARET
[lacking feeling] We like to spread holiday cheer.

Her tone clearly indicates that she and Leo have spread so much holiday cheer, that 
they have none left for themselves.

LEO
[looking at a card] Who the hell is this guy and why do I care if he has a Merry Christmas?

MARGARET
Just sign the damn thing.

LEO
Leave us alone for a minute.

MARGARET
We’re not done yet.

LEO
Two minutes!

MARGARET
Sure.

Margaret grabs her clipboard and heads towards her office, but not before shooting an 
unhappy look at Leo before closing the door.

JOSH
I’m tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
Lillienfield’s got this information. He’s gonna hold it till after Christmas when people 
are watching. I don’t want to tell you too much, but I want to make an attempt at a 
preemptive strike.

LEO
Well, you got to tell me more than that.

JOSH
Sam knows a girl.

LEO
I’ve heard rumors.

JOSH
I want to talk to her.

LEO
Nope.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
Absolutely not.

JOSH
I’m saying--

LEO
Josh!

JOSH
I’m saying something to keep in our pockets.

LEO
I don’t want it in my pocket. I don’t want it in your pocket, Sam’s pocket, and I sure 
don’t want it in the President’s pocket.

JOSH
Lillienfield is coming down the mountain. Leo, this is no joke.

LEO
You don’t have to tell me it’s no joke, Josh. It’s my life. All I’m saying is we don’t 
do these things.

JOSH
[a little too quickly] All right. 

LEO
All right?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Listen, you hear about this kid in Minnesota?

JOSH
No.

LEO
A gay high school senior. He got beaten up, then they stripped him naked, tied him to a 
tree and threw rocks and bottles at his head. You know how old the assailants were? Thirteen.

JOSH
[beat] Is the kid dead?

LEO
He’s in critical condition. This is all by way of saying we’re gonna have to revisit hate 
crimes legislation after the break.

JOSH
Oh, well we ought to gauge reaction before we say anything.

LEO
C.J.’s gonna send up a test balloon at her briefing. 

JOSH
All right.

LEO
Margaret!

MARGARET
[comes in] Yes, sir?

LEO
Let’s get this over with.

JOSH
See you later.

LEO
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is holding a briefing.

C.J.
The President is scheduled to leave for New Hampshire tomorrow morning at precisely 
10 a.m. on the dot, no hold ups, no delays, which means he ought to be leaving around 
noon. He’ll spend Christmas Eve at the Manchester house, then attend Christmas services 
with his family in the morning.

BOBBI
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

BOBBI
Is the White House aware that a high school student was attacked?

C.J.
Yeah, his name is Lowell Lydell, he’s seventeen years old, he’s in critical condition 
at Saint Paul Memorial Hospital with a severely fractured skull, massive internal 
hemorrhaging, and various broken bones and lacerations. We’ll keep you updated through 
local authorities.

BOBBI
Do you think that this will revisit the debate on hate crime legislation?

C.J.
Yes, I do. Though I suppose the best time to do that was the day before Lowell Lydell 
got his brains beaten out and not the day after. Who’s next?
 
CUT TO: INT. TOBY’S OFFICE - DAY
Toby is leaning against his desk, which has several books about the Korean War on it. 
He is looking at a notepad and talking on the phone.

TOBY
[on the phone] Walter Hufnagle. I don’t know... I don’t know! I’ve been holding on for-- 
I say I’ve been holding on for the better part of-- Sure. Yeah.

MANDY
[knocks] Are you busy?

TOBY
I’m holding.

MANDY
What’s going on?

TOBY
A homeless Korean War Vet died of exposure out on the mall last night. I don’t know if 
his family’s been contacted, I don’t know... what kind of burial...

MANDY
How do you know him?

TOBY
I don’t.

MANDY
Then what does it matter to you?

TOBY
Don’t worry about it. What do you need?

MANDY
This might seem trivial under the circumstances. 

TOBY
What?

MANDY
The Santa hats do clash with the Dickensian costumes. 

TOBY
It might seem trivial?

MANDY
Just keeping you in the loop.

TOBY
[into phone] Yes, I’m here. 
[to Mandy] Go away. 

MANDY
Yeah, I know. [leaves] 

Toby listens on the phone for a moment, then pulls it away from his ear in disgust, 
then brings it back to listen.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is walking back to his office when approached by Donna.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
I need to talk to you.

JOSH
Donna, I can assure you I’m giving your Christmas list the consideration it...

DONNA
Seriously. [They stop] What’s going on with Leo?

Josh looks at her for a moment, and then closes his door to give them some privacy.

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
I just heard something.

JOSH
From who?

DONNA
From Margaret.

JOSH
The two of you shouldn’t be...

DONNA
Yeah, but we did.

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
Is it true?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Well?

JOSH
Well, what?

DONNA
What are you gonna do?

JOSH
For the moment nothing, we’re gonna--

DONNA
Josh... 

JOSH
We’re gonna wait and see how-- 

DONNA
You’re gonna wait and see?

JOSH
There’s not much else we can do.

DONNA
We’ll wait and see?

JOSH
Yes. 

She gives Josh a very sympathetic look.

JOSH
Could you stop looking at me with the face?

DONNA
It’s my face.

JOSH
Like I just killed your hamster?

DONNA
[rolls her eyes] I just think if the tables were turned... 

JOSH
Donna.

DONNA
If one of us were in trouble, he would be the first person to-- 

JOSH
I know! [beat] I know.

DONNA
It was my regular face, Josh. I wasn’t trying to guilt you.

JOSH
I know... I have to work.

DONNA
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
C.J. is leading a couple dozen small schoolchildren into the room. The children look 
in awe at the magnificent Christmas tree in the middle of the room. Reporters are 
standing around behind velvet ropes to snapping away pictures.

C.J.
Okay kids, remember the drill, in a big voice you’ll say your name, your grade and then 
you’ll ask the President the question that you and your teacher have prepared and 
written down on your index card. [glances up to an agent, who nods subtlely]
[to kids] Okay, how about a big, “Good morning Mr. President!” when he comes in the 
room? Here we go.

C.J. steps aside as Bartlet comes around the corner and walks in front of the kids.

KIDS
Good morning Mr. President!

BARTLET
Oh that sounded pretty weak to me. Let’s try it again. [cups his ear]

KIDS
Good morning, Mr. President!

BARTLET
That’s better. Now who are all these people making a ruckus and tracking up my floor? 
[points to a young boy] You! What’s your name?

JEFFREY
Jeffrey Lucas.

BARTLET
And when are you gonna get taller, huh? What are you, fifteen, sixteen years old?

JEFFREY
[laughs] I’m seven.

BARTLET
Well, all right then, you’re fine. All right, lets go. Come on, I’m a busy man. I am, 
after all, the President of Bulgaria.

KIDS
No!

C.J. laughs at the Bartlet’s antics.

BARTLET
Now, wait a second. That’s not right. I’m not the President of Bulgaria. I am the 
President of the Great Kingdom of Luxembourg.

KIDS
Noooo!

BARTLET
Now hold on, I know I’m the President of something... 

KIDS
America!

BARTLET
Yes! Thank you. I am the President of the United States of America. Now, who has a question?

KIDS
Me! Me! Me!

He points to a cute, little girl with glasses, and kneels down in front of her.

BARTLET
Yes, ma’am.

JESSICA
My name is Jessica Hodges, and I’m in the third grade, and this is my question: 
What’s your favorite part about being President?

BARTLET
My favorite part about being President?

JESSICA
Yes.

BARTLET
I’m doing it right now. [kisses the girl on the forehead] Who’s next? All right. 

KIDS
Me! Me! Me!

C.J. approaches.

BARTLET
[to kids] Wait. Hang on a second.

C.J. whispers something to him.

BARTLET
Okay. [to the kids] Apparently, there’s a group of kids in the other room that I might 
like better.

KIDS
No!

Bartlet and C.J. walk over to the foray where Charlie is standing. 

CHARLIE
I’m sorry to interrupt, sir, but you asked me to keep you posted.

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Lowell Lydell died about 15 minutes ago.

The bad news hits him. The kids suddenly become quiet. Bartlet takes a moment to respond.

BARTLET
Okay. Send some flowers. Then I’ll call his parents. 

C.J.
Yeah.

BARTLET
Okay. [looks at Charlie once more, then returns to the group of waiting children]
All right, now on with the questions. Now wait a minute, when you address me, please 
bear in mind that you are speaking to His Royal Majesty, The King of all England.

KIDS
No!

BARTLET
Oh, what was it again?

KIDS
America!

BARTLET
Yes.
 
FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Sam is standing in the hallway reading some papers, when C.J. rounds the corner and 
approaches. They talk on the way through the hallway to their offices.

SAM
Hey.

C.J.
Hey. 

SAM
Saw your briefing.

C.J.
What’d I do?

SAM
I’m not sure I’d put my foot on the gas so hard with hate crimes legislation.

C.J.
First of all, I barely grazed the gas. Second of all, why not?

SAM
Because we’re not sure where we stand on this.

C.J.
I know where I stand on this.

SAM
Congratulations, but the rest of us... 

C.J.
They threw rocks at his head.

SAM
I understand, but I’m just saying... 

C.J.
Ah. I’ll keep my food off the gas.

SAM
Thank you.

C.J.
What’s your secret service code name?

SAM
They just changed them.

C.J.
I know, what’s yours?

SAM
Princeton.

C.J.
Mine’s Flamingo.

SAM
It’s nice.

C.J.
No. It’s not nice.

SAM
[stops walking] Flamingo is a nice looking bird.

C.J.
The flamingo is a ridiculous looking bird.

SAM
You’re not ridiculous looking.

C.J.
I know I’m not ridiculous looking.

SAM
Any way for me to get out of this conversation?

C.J.
I’m gonna go talk to someone.

SAM
Excellent.

C.J. leaves. Sam continues winding his way to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

BONNIE
Sam? How you doing?

SAM
I’m going to be in Bermuda in 27 hours, that’s how I’m doing. Where’s Toby?

GINGER
He said he had to run out of the office.

JOSH
[enters] Sam?

SAM
Hey.

JOSH
You got a sec?

SAM
Yeah. 83 degrees in Bermuda.

GINGER
Sam. [hands him some messages]

SAM
Just me, some sun tan oil and 655 pages of briefing memos.

They walk inside SAM'S OFFICE. Josh closes the door.

JOSH
I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about your friend.

SAM
What happened?

JOSH
Nothing, listen...  you would describe her as, I’m sorry, what was her name again?

SAM
Laurie.

JOSH
She’s expensive?

SAM
Josh, I assure you, I would have no way of knowing...
  
JOSH
I understand, but...

SAM
Yes.

JOSH
Yeah?

SAM
Very expensive.

JOSH
She’s elite?

SAM
Yes. Why are we talking about this?

JOSH
Sam, I need to know if she would divulge the name or names of any influential Republican 
members of congress that she might have...
 
SAM
No way.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
I’m telling you no way, Josh.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
Josh!

JOSH
There’s a thing that’s gonna happen.

SAM
What?

JOSH
Lillienfield knows that Leo’s a recovering alcoholic. 

SAM
Everyone knows that Leo is a recovering alcoholic. 

JOSH
Yeah, but they don’t know that there were pills. There was Valium. He was in rehab.

SAM
When?

JOSH
Six years ago.

SAM
He was Secretary of Labor six years ago.

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
He was high when he was running the Labor Department. 

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
And Lillienfield knows this?

JOSH
I’m fairly sure that’s why he started this in the first place. Lillienfield’s going hunting.
[beat] Sam, we owe Leo everything. I mean everything.

SAM
I’ll call her, and we’ll go see her together.

JOSH
Thanks.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Charlie is exiting the Oval Office with some files. Mrs. Landingham enters.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes, ma’am.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
It’s important you remind the President throughout the day that he’s allergic to eggnog.

CHARLIE
Sure.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Thank you.

She sits at her desk and begins to work on the computer. Charlie leans on his desk and 
watches her. A staffer walks through with big holiday decorations. The entire room is 
full of red ribbons, wreaths, and such.

CHARLIE
This place looks great doesn’t it?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
I’ve never seen a Christmas look like this, the trees, and the lights, and everybody singing.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
The presents... 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
I brought it up because, I don’t know, you seem a little down this week.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah, I know Charlie. I tend to get a little down during he holidays.

CHARLIE
You don’t like Christmas?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I miss my boys.

CHARLIE
I never knew you had kids.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Twins. Andrew and Simon. I tried not, you know, I dressed them differently, but they 
still did everything together. They went off to medical school together, and then they 
finished their second year at the same time, and of course their lottery number came up 
at the same time.

CHARLIE
For the draft?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Well I would have thought they could get a deferment to finish med school.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
They didn’t want one. Their father and I begged them, but they wanted to go where people 
needed doctors. Their father and I begged them, but you can’t tell kids anything. So they 
joined up as medics and four months later hey were pinned down during a fight in DaNang 
and were killed by enemy fire. That was Christmas Eve 1970. 
[beat] You know, they were so young, Charlie, they were your age. It’s hard when that 
happens so far away, you know because, with the noises and the shooting, they had to be 
so scared. It’s hard not to think that right then they needed their mother... Anyway, 
I miss my boys.

She looks up for a moment, then back to some papers on her desk.
  
CHARLIE
[softly] Okay. 

Charlie walks away as Mrs. Landingham continues to work on the papers, trying to put 
thoughts of her boys out of her head.

CUT TO: EXT. KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL - DAY
Toby is looking at the Korean War Memorial, and then glances to the park bench where the

it’s veterans. 

STAND WORKER
What to sign the book?

TOBY
Excuse me?

STAND WORKER
Sign the book?

TOBY
Sure.

STAND WORKER
Ah, you looking for anything in particular? 

TOBY
No. No. Just... I’m not a visitor. I was, uh... I’m not the police. I was... [beat] 
A homeless man died this morning near the monument. [gestures to the park bench]

STAND WORKER
Yeah, when the weather gets down... 

TOBY
Occurred to me that maybe he slept there a lot, maybe you knew him.

STAND WORKER
Yeah, he was one of them. Was he a friend of yours?

TOBY
No.

STAND WORKER
I didn’t think so.

TOBY
I’m just trying to contact someone that might, you know, be interested that he died.

STAND WORKER
They usually hang out around Capital and “P,” I’d try there.

TOBY
Thanks. [starts to walk away, but turns back] You a veteran?

STAND WORKER
Yeah.

TOBY
[offers his hand] Toby Zeigler.

STAND WORKER
John Noonan. [They shake hands.]

TOBY
Merry Christmas.

STAND WORKER
Merry Christmas.

John Noonan watches thoughtfully as Toby walks away.

Bartlet and Mandy are arguing while Charlie and a few Secret Service Agents stand by. 
Bartlet is putting on his coat as if he is getting ready to leave.

MANDY
A couple of guys.

BARTLET
No.

MANDY
Mr. President a couple of guys.

BARTLET
Leave me alone.

JOSH
[enters] Good morning Mr. President.

BARTLET
Josh, what are you doing right now?

JOSH
I’m helping prepare a strategy for the European economic summit in February.

BARTLET
Blow it off.

JOSH
[flippant] Okay.

BARTLET
Seriously, take an hour and come with us.

JOSH
You’re going shopping?

MANDY
He won’t let me send some press along.

BARTLET
Leave me alone.

JOSH
I don’t understand. How are you going shopping?

BARTLET
Oh I sneak out every now and then.

JOSH
You sneak out?

BARTLET
Yes, couple of agents, an unmarked black suburban. They tell the manager, they clear 
the store, I’m in, I’m out. It’s like nothing ever happened.

JOSH
I never knew this.

BARTLET
Did you know that there’s an underground tunnel out of here?

JOSH
Yes.

BARTLET
I haven’t been able to find it even though I search almost everyday.

JOSH
Where are you going?

BARTLET
To a place called Rare Books, you know what they sell?

JOSH
Fishing tackle?

BARTLET
Funny boy.

MANDY
The President is doing some last minute Christmas shopping at a rare bookstore and he 
won’t let me send some press along.

BARTLET
Tell her to leave me alone. Sheila!

MANDY
A couple of guys.

BARTLET
This is a Christmas thing I’m doing Mandy; we don’t have to make hay out of it.

MANDY
It’s such good hay.

BARTLET
[to Josh] Want to come?

JOSH
An hour with you in a rare bookstore? Couldn’t you just drop me off the top of the 
Washington monument instead?

BARTLET
It’s Christmas, Josh! No reason we can’t do both. 

JOSH
I suppose.

BARTLET
Let’s go shopping!

The group exits the Oval Office.

STAFFER
Okay, I got it.

Hey C.J.

C.J.
Hello Danny.

DANNY
I saw the black suburban in back. President’s slipping away, huh?

C.J.
He suddenly realized he’d forgotten to get you a Christmas gift.

DANNY
How sweet.

C.J.
Yes.

DANNY
So, I’ve put together a list.

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
Of reasons why you should go out with me.

C.J.
Really?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
Well I’ll tell you what, give me a couple of hours to put together a list of reasons 
why I shouldn’t, then we’ll compare them and see where we are. [stops to face him]
My secret service code name is Flamingo. 

DANNY
Nice bird.

C.J.
Go away.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. watches Danny as he walks away and doesn’t hear Sam pass by. She follows as she sees him.

SAM
Hey.

C.J.
Sam?

SAM
Yup?

C.J.
What do you and Josh have going on tonight?

SAM
[nervously] Nothing.

C.J.
I just meant did you want to come over for dinner.

SAM
Oh, yeah.

C.J.
What did you think I meant?

SAM
I’m going to Bermuda tonight.

C.J.
Okay. Yeah, that’s right.

SAM
What?

C.J.
What did you think I meant?

SAM
It’s what I thought you meant.

C.J.
Then why did you say nothing if you are going to Bermuda tonight?

SAM
I really don’t know.

C.J.
Okay.

SAM
But thank you for the invitation.

C.J.
Okay. Sam. [stops] What have you and Josh have going on tonight?

SAM
Nothing. [quickly leaves]

CUT TO: INT. RARE BOOKS STORE - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are skimming through the bookshelves in an aisle. Bartlet suddenly 
stops and grabs a book and begins to examine it.

BARTLET
Oooh! “The Fables of Phaedrus,” 1886, first edition, red leather label, gilt lettering, 
engraved frontice. Phaedrus, you know, who was a slave, but later granted his freedom 
by Augustus, wrote his animal fables in iambic verse.

LEO
Well, nothing says Christmas like animal fables in iambic verse.

BARTLET
That’s what I say.

Mandy and Josh are in the next aisle.

MANDY
A few photographers would have killed him?

JOSH
Let it go.

MANDY
I’m just saying.

JOSH
Ah. Here’s one. [grabs a book from the shelf to look at]

MANDY
One what?

JOSH
A book which if I was stuck with it on a desert island, I still wouldn’t read it, 
“The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California.” 
I believe I would eat this book before I read it.

Bartlet and Leo pass Josh and Mandy and walk to another aisle.

BARTLET
So, you won’t change your mind?

LEO
Nope. I appreciate it, but... 

BARTLET
So you’re gonna sit around in your hotel room by yourself?

LEO
I’ve got plenty to do at the office.

BARTLET
Oh! So you’re gonna work on Christmas? Good, that makes me feel better.

LEO
Look... 

BARTLET
Come to Manchester, stay at the house.

LEO
Oh, so you could read aloud from “The Fables of Phaedrus”?

BARTLET
I wasn’t planning on doing that, but now that you suggest it.

LEO
I’ll be fine.

BARTLET
Suit yourself.

They are quiet for a moment. Leo comes closer and lowers his voice. Bartlet is examining 
a new book he has found.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
When you get back from the holiday I’m afraid we’ll have to start talking seriously 
about my situation.

BARTLET
I’m not worried about it Leo.

LEO
I know you’re not, but that doesn’t... 

BARTLET
It’ll be fine, these things can go away by themselves.

LEO
No they can’t, sir, and they usually don’t. I’m gonna need an exit strategy that’ll 
cause the least embarrassment and turmoil during the Mendoza confirmation.

BARTLET
I don’t want to talk about an exit strategy.

LEO
Sir?!

BARTLET
I really don’t. It’s gonna be fine.

CHARLIE
[approaches] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

CHARLIE
It’s time.

BARTLET
All right. You know Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about 
getting this for her. “The Nature of Things. A Viviscalic Poem Translated from the 
Latin of Titus Lucrecius Carus.”

Leo looks to Charlie with a disbelieving look.

CHARLIE
[deadpan] Well, I think she would like that better than a new stereo, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah. Because it’s got brown Moroccan spine labels.

CHARLIE
Why don’t you head for the car and I’ll pay for the books.

BARTLET
All right, thanks. [to the shop keepers] Thank you all, Merry Christmas! 

Bartlet walks away as Leo walks over to Josh.

LEO
You heard what I said before right?

JOSH
What?

LEO
In my office this morning?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
Ok?

JOSH
Yeah.

Bartlet comes back with two more books in his hands and gives them to Leo.

BARTLET
“Life of Epicurus”, two volumes.

LEO
Let’s go. 

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. UNDERPASS OF WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT
Toby approaches a large group of homeless people in a soup line ran by volunteers. 
Toby is very uncomfortable and unsure of himself. He tries to get their attention.
 
TOBY
Excuse me. Ah, excuse me, I was wondering if by any chance you know a man named of 
Walter Hufnagle?

HOMELESS MAN
Walter?

TOBY
Yes.

HOMELESS MAN
You looking for Walter?

TOBY
I wasn’t looking for him. I was, uh...

HOMELESS MAN
There’s his brother down there. [points]

TOBY
Oh thank you. [starts to walk to the man that was pointed out]

HOMELESS MAN
What’s the problem?

TOBY
Oh, there’s no problem. Down on the end?

HOMELESS MAN
Yeah. Listen, he’s a little slow. I mean, he’s all right and everything. He’s just a 
little slow.

TOBY
Thanks. 

Toby walks under the bridge overpass, where dozens of homeless people are huddled around 
fires trying to keep warm. He approaches an older man, GEORGE HUFNAGLE. Like others, George
is sitting by a fire.

TOBY
Excuse me. Mr. Hufnagle?

GEORGE
I’m George.

TOBY
Are you, uh, Walter Hufnagle’s brother?

GEORGE
Yeah.

TOBY
I’m afraid I have some very bad news. Walter died last night.

GEORGE
Oh, jeez.

TOBY
It was a very cold night.

GEORGE
Yeah. ‘Cause of the North Easterly wind off the Chesapeake.

The homeless man that pointed George out to Toby approaches them.

HOMELESS MAN
Is everything all right?

GEORGE
Walter died.

HOMELESS MAN
Who are you?

TOBY
I’m, I’m... I’m Toby Zeigler. Uh, Walter was wearing my coat and it had my business card... 

HOMELESS MAN
You want your coat back?

TOBY
No.

GEORGE
The North Easterly wind off the Chesapeake.

TOBY
George, did you know your brother fought in Korea? 

GEORGE
Oh, I’m sure he didn’t mean nothing.

TOBY
No, no. Uh, he...
 
GEORGE
Sometimes people start things and they... 

TOBY
No, uh, he was in the Marines about forty-five years ago.

GEORGE
Yeah, I think I remember.

TOBY
He was given a medal.

GEORGE
Yeah?

TOBY
It’s called the Purple Heart. It’s for getting wounded in battle.

GEORGE
He was wounded?

TOBY
Yeah.

GEORGE
I guess he wasn’t too good at it, huh?

TOBY
No, no. Uh, a lot of people were wounded or even killed.

GEORGE
Were you there?

TOBY
No, no I was-- Anyway, uh, I wasn’t sure if anyone had, you know, contacted you.

GEORGE
I slept over there at the shelter last night because of the North Easterly wind off 
the Chesapeake.

TOBY
Yeah, it was -- it was pretty cold.

GEORGE
Yeah. And I guess there weren’t enough beds for Walter.

TOBY
Yeah. I’m sorry. Goodnight. [turns to walk away, but he can’t leave yet]
I’m, I’m sorry. This is absolutely none of my business. Your brother is entitled to a 
proper funeral with mourners and I think he deserves an honor guard, and you don’t know 
me, but I’m an in... I’m an influential person. [sighs in frustration with himself]
I’m a very powerful person. And I would like to arrange it.

GEORGE
A funeral?

TOBY
[turns to the other homeless man] Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

HOMELESS MAN
Yeah.

TOBY
[to George] So that if I come and pick you up in the morning and I’ll bring you back after.

HOMELESS MAN
I’ll make sure he’s here.

TOBY
Will you? [walks towards the homeless man] Thank you. Thank you. Let me just, uh...
[reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of bills and gives them all to the homeless
man for him and George] Here... uh... please just take it. [starts to walk away quickly]

HOMELESS MAN
Nah man, that’s all your money.

TOBY
That’s ok, thank you.

HOMELESS MAN
No, you don’t live around here.

TOBY
No.

HOMELESS MAN
You gonna need it for the bus.

TOBY
I’m fine. Thanks.

HOMELESS MAN
Here. Take it. [hands the money back]

TOBY
Really. I’m fine.

HOMELESS MAN
You don’t live around here.

TOBY
Thanks. [takes the money and quickly leaves]

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - NIGHT
C.J. is leaning against her desk reading a list to Danny who is sitting in a chair 
listening in amusement.
 
C.J.
You are a reporter. I’m The Press Secretary. It’s an unavoidable conflict of interest. 
It would hurt my reputation. It would hurt your reputation. Your editors would obviously... 

DANNY
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
What are you doing?

C.J.
I’m reading you my list.

DANNY
You really made a list?

C.J.
Didn’t you?

DANNY
Sure.

C.J.
You didn’t make a list.

DANNY
I made a list, got it right here.

C.J.
You said you made a list.

DANNY
I made a mental list.

C.J.
Well, I made an actual list.

DANNY
I can see.

C.J.
What did you come in here for?

DANNY
To give you your Christmas present.

He stands up and reaches into his coat pocket to produce a small cylinder shaped gift.

C.J.
You already gave me a goldfish Danny, what more could a girl possible want? 

He watches as she rips into the wrapping paper to reveal--

C.J.
Goldfish food.

DANNY
I’m gonna ignore your list ‘cause I think it’s ridiculous. Also ‘cause I got a crush on you.

CAROL
[stands in the doorway] C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

CAROL
Leo’s here?

Danny grabs his coat and heads for the door as Leo enters.

DANNY
See you later.

LEO
Hey Danny.

DANNY
Hey Leo.

LEO
That’s a nice goldfish.

DANNY
Isn’t it?

LEO
Happy Holidays.

DANNY
You too. [leaves]

LEO
C.J.

C.J.
I’m rebuffing his advances, Leo.

LEO
Whatever. Listen, dial down the rhetoric on hate crimes would you?

C.J.
You told me to float a test balloon.

LEO
Float it. Don’t shove it down anyone’s throat. I don’t know which way we’re gonna come 
down on this one.

C.J.
They made him say “Hail Mary’s” as they beat him to death. This was a crime of entertainment.

LEO
C.J.... 

C.J.
Beyond the crime itself is a manifestation of racism, or sexism, or anti Semitism or 
homophobia that are only a tip of the iceberg of the pathology troubling this country.

LEO
I’m aware of all that. I’m just not sure it’s right to legislate against how someone thinks. 
A lot of people aren’t sure, a lot of ‘em work here and I’m telling ya’ to dial it down.

C.J.
Okay.

LEO
Thank you.

C.J.
[sits] You have plans yet?

LEO
For Christmas?

C.J.
Yeah.

LEO
My plan is to do nothing.

C.J.
Want me to come cook you something?

LEO
[smiles incredulously] What are you my mother?

C.J.
I was just asking.

LEO
I’ll see you later. [leaves]

CUT TO: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET IN WASHINGTON - NIGHT
Sam and Josh stand at the front door to a house and ring the doorbell. Laurie answers. 
She has just gotten out of the shower, wearing a robe and drying her hair with a towel.
 
SAM
Hi.

LAURIE
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

The mood in the room is tense.

SAM
This is Josh Lyman.

LAURIE
Hi. 

JOSH
Hi.

LAURIE
Come in.

Sam and Josh walk into the front room and Laurie closes the door behind them. Sam and Josh 
look somewhat nervous and apprehensive.

SAM
Hi.

LAURIE
Well, like I said on the phone, I only have a few minutes.

SAM
Right, we’ll get right to the point.

LAURIE
Please.

SAM
Right. Here’s what’s going on. A guy we work with is in some trouble. We believe a 
congressman is about to expose something about his past that’s gonna be damaging to him. 
And doing what you do in the universe in which you do it, we though that maybe... 

Laurie walks around Sam, upset with what he is proposing.

LAURIE
I could give you a name of an influential Republican who likes to have kinky sex so 
that you could scare Lillienfield into shutting up?

SAM
I never said that it was Lillienfield.

LAURIE
Is it Lillienfield?

SAM
Yes.

LAURIE
This is for real? This isn’t a joke of some kind? 

SAM
This is for real.

LAURIE
[beat] Then get out and we’ll pretend that this never happened.

JOSH
Hey, haven’t we met?

LAURIE
Yes we have.

JOSH
Where?

SAM
White House. She came to the state dinner with Carl Everett.

LAURIE
Who raised about five million dollars in the mid-west for Bartlet. Did you think that 
only Republicans pay for sex? 

SAM
Laurie, this really isn’t about... 

LAURIE
I can’t believe you. What, did you get this out of a book?

JOSH
It was my idea.

LAURIE
Oh! What are you, the brains of the outfit?

JOSH
[voice rising] Yeah, I am. And I got to tell you, I could care less about your indignation 
right now. A man has left himself open to the kind of attack from which men in my business 
don't recover. Now if our tactics seem less than civilized it’s because so are our attackers 
and in any event I don’t feel like standing here taking a civics lesson from a hooker!

SAM
Josh!

JOSH
We don’t need your cooperation, Laurie, one of your guys wrote you a check and the I.R.S. 
works for me.

LAURIE
Get the hell out of my house.

JOSH
Just give me a name. What do you want? Money? I’ll give you money!

LAURIE
Oh fine, I’ll give you a name, and then I’ll hope back into the shower and you can leave 
the money on the nightstand. How ‘bout that?

SAM
I don’t think he meant--

LAURIE
Yes, he did!

JOSH
No, I didn’t. [turns away in frustration, then turns back to Laurie]
In fact I’m sorry. I apologize. That was very rude.

SAM
We wouldn’t have asked Laurie, but this person means a lot to us.

LAURIE
You’re the good guys. You should act like it.

JOSH
Yeah.

LAURIE
I have to get dressed now.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24
Leo is sitting at his desk and is talking to C.J. about hate crimes legislation. 
Margaret walks in with more Christmas presents and cards for Leo to sign.
 
C.J.
Yeah, but we’re not just talking about burning a cross on someone’s lawn. People are 
getting killed.

LEO
And people get punished for committing that crime. Do you also want to start punishing 
them for what’s in their mind when they commit it?

C.J.
Yes.

LEO
Really?

C.J.
Yes.

Leo looks disdainfully at the card Margaret hands to him.

LEO
Who is this?

MARGARET
[reading a tag on the present] Elizabeth.

LEO
Who’s Elizabeth?

MARGARET
[checks her clipboard] Your sister.

C.J.
I’m saying this is an abstract theory. It’s not enough to say we’re protecting people’s 
civil rights; we have to actually do it. Plus it has the added benefit of being good politics.

LEO
Ah, see? Now I’m listening.

C.J.
We’ll get into it after the break?

LEO
We’ll get into it after the break.

JOSH
[enters with Sam] Excuse me.

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
You wanted to see us?

Leo stands from his chair and Margaret packs up the gifts to leave.

LEO
Oh yes, very much.

C.J.
I should leave?

LEO
As quickly as possible. 

C.J. and Margaret exit the office, while Leo looks at Josh and Sam.

LEO
You went and did it?

JOSH
What?

LEO
Exactly what I asked you not to do.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
You went and saw Sam’s friend?

SAM
How’d you know?

LEO
I had you tailed.

JOSH
You had us tailed?

LEO
Yes.

SAM
Why did you have us tailed?

LEO
On the off chance that you’re as stupid as you look. Whose idea was this?

JOSH
It was mine. Sam was a reluctant accomplice. You had us tailed?

LEO
Get over it.

SAM
She didn’t give us anything.

LEO
I should hope not.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
It’s not what we do, Josh.

SAM
That maybe true, but still... 

LEO
It’s not what we do.

SAM
Yes, sir.

LEO
You should apologize to that girl for even asking. 

SAM
I did.

LEO
Then apologize again.

SAM
Yes, sir.

LEO
Like I’m not gonna have enough problems without the Keystone Cops.

JOSH
We meant well.

LEO
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

JOSH
No.

LEO
[beat] Well, it does.

JOSH
I’m glad.

LEO
Go back to work.

SAM
It’s Christmas Eve.

LEO
What, the country isn’t open Christmas Eve?

SAM
Fair point. [leaves]

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
I know.

JOSH
It’s gonna get bad before it gets better.

LEO
I know. [beat] Margaret! Lets get this over with.

JOSH
I’m here Christmas.

LEO
Okay.
 
Josh leaves and Margaret comes back with an armload of brightly wrapped Christmas 
presents. Leo just looks at them in unpleasant surprise.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is giving a briefing to the White House Press Corps.

C.J.
There’s been no change with the Presidents departure time of 10 a.m. so we’re still 
looking at about noon. This is a half day for us, so I’m gonna make it a half day for 
you too. There is no more news from The White House. The lid is on. Have a Merry Christmas. 

REPORTERS
Merry Christmas.

C.J. starts to walk back to her office, grabbing Danny on the way.

C.J.
Hey, Fishboy. 

C.J. continues to walk, while Danny hurries to follow.

C.J.
Answer me this, and when you do bear in mind there’s a lot riding on it.

DANNY
On what?

C.J.
Your answer.

DANNY
What’s riding on it?

C.J.
[turns quickly and stops] A date with me.

DANNY
Fire.

C.J.
Don’t you think imposing additional penalties for hate-motivated crimes is a powerful 
statement by society against tolerance?

DANNY
No. A crime is a crime. One murder isn’t any better or worse than another.

C.J.
Boy, was that the wrong answer.

DANNY
Punishing people for their beliefs is, the beginning of the end. Once more you agree 
with me.

C.J.
I don’t agree with you.

DANNY
Ok.

C.J.
Take me out tonight and convince me.

DANNY
Excuse me?

C.J.
You heard me.

DANNY
I didn’t, ‘cause there was -- I was distracted by a thing.

C.J.
I’m not gonna say it again.

DANNY
Ok, then I’m gonna assume that you asked me out. [walks away]

C.J.
[quickly follows] I didn’t ask you out. You asked me out about forty-nine times and I’m 
saying yes to one of them.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
You understand we’re having dinner right?

DANNY
I understand.

C.J.
We’re not having a fling.

DANNY
I understand.

C.J.
This is a business dinner, in fact bring your notebook. 

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
[stops] My secret service name is Flamingo.

DANNY
That’s nice.

C.J.
I have to feed my fish.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. walks into her office leaving Danny in wonderment at what just happened. Josh 
is standing by the bullpen.

JOSH
Hey Danny.

DANNY
Hey Josh.

JOSH
How’s it going?

DANNY
Hard to say.

JOSH
Okay.

DANNY
Okay.

Danny walks away as the camera moves to Donna, who is sitting at her desk opening her 
Christmas gift from Josh. He watches on as she reveals a book.

DONNA
"Heimlich Beckengruber on The Art and Artistry of Alpine Skiing."

JOSH
It’s got a molted calf cover and original drab boards.

DONNA
I don’t know what to say.

JOSH
I wrote a note inside. 

Donna opens the book and begins to read what Josh has written. She is obviously 
affected by his words.

JOSH
Donna, don’t get emotional. Donna, don’t get... let’s try and maintain some kind of... 

He’s looking around the bullpen embarrassed. Oblivious to his concerns of propriety, 
Donna closes the book, stands up, and approaches Josh.

DONNA
[tearfully] You see!? You spend most of our time being, you know, you. Then you write 
something like this to me. Thank you.

She pulls him into a tight hug. Josh, forgetting impropriety, hugs her back.

JOSH
I meant it.

DONNA
Skis would have killed you?

JOSH
[pulls back] Yeah.

DONNA
Okay.
 
Josh walks away to his office. He stops in his doorway to look back to her. Donna is 
back at her desk, re-reading his note, smiling.

CUT TO: INT. MURAL ROOM - DAY
A crowd of people applauds as Bartlet enters the room. A children’s choir is arranged 
at one side of the room.

BARTLET
Hello everybody. Welcome to The White House. [sees a young boy and shakes his hand]
Joey. Welcome to the White House.

The camera moves to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE as Toby enters.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good morning Toby.

TOBY
Good morning Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President would like to see you.

TOBY
I know.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Did you use his name to arrange a military funeral for a homeless veteran?

TOBY
Yes.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You shouldn’t have done that Toby.

TOBY
I know.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You absolutely should not have done that. 

TOBY
I know.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President is in the Mural Room.

TOBY
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The boys’ choir starts to sing “Little Drummer Boy” as Bartlet and the rest of the 
crowd listens. Mandy is standing next to Bartlet.

MANDY
[whispering] How would it be if I just mentioned... 

BARTLET
[under breath] No.

MANDY
Christmas shopping on your own at a bookstore?

BARTLET
Deal with it. 

BARTLET
[spots Toby by the door, to Mandy] I’ll be right back.

He and Toby leave the Mural Room and walk to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Nancy greets them.

NANCY
Merry Christmas Mr. President.

BARTLET
Merry Christmas, Nancy. 

Bartlet and Toby enter THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Hi.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How you doing?

TOBY 
I’m fine. Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Apparently I’ve arranged for an honor guard for somebody.

TOBY
Yes, sir, I’m sorry, I... 

BARTLET
No, no, just tell me, is there anything else I’ve arranged for? We’re still in NATO, right?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What’s going on?

TOBY
A homeless man died last night, a Korean War Veteran, who was wearing a coat I had gave 
to the Goodwill. It had my card in it.

BARTLET
Toby, you’re not responsible... 

TOBY
An hour and twenty minutes for the ambulance to get there. A Lance Corporal, United 
States Marine Corps, Second of the Seventh. The guy got better treatment at Panmunjong.

BARTLET
Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don’t think every homeless veteran 
would come out of the woodworks? 

TOBY
I can only hope, sir.

BARTLET
[beat] When is this thing?

TOBY
I’m going to pick up his brother and go there now. 

MANDY
[appears by the doorway] Mr. President, sir? Your absence in the other room is conspicuous.

BARTLET
Okay.

Bartlet looks at Toby once more and then pats him on the shoulder. He follows Mandy back 
to the Mural Room. Toby leaves the Oval Office and is about to leave for the funeral. 
He passes Mrs. Landingham on the way. She is putting on her coat and hat to go outside.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Toby, I’d like to come along. 

He gestures for her to join him.

The episode ends with a montage of juxtaposing shots of the military funeral for 
Walter Hufnagle and the activity in THE MURAL ROOM. Throughout, we can hear the boys’ 
choir sing “Little Drummer Boy.”

The hearse arrives at ARLINGTON CEMETERY, SECTION 43. Toby, Mrs. Landingham, and George 
get out of the car. George is holding a bouquet of flowers. The honor guard carries the 
casket to the grave. They begin the ritual of folding the flag that covered the casket.

THE MURAL ROOM. Sam and C.J. join Mandy and Bartlet. Then, Charlie and Leo join.

ARLINGTON CEMETERY. The honor guard starts to shoot their rifles in salute. Toby flinches 
with the first shot. Mrs. Landingham with the second.

THE MURAL ROOM. Donna and Josh join the group.

ARLINGTON CEMETERY. The honor guard starts to hand the tightly folded flag to Toby who 
gestures uncomfortably to George, who is then presented with the flag. George gently 
places the flowers on the casket. They all stand to leave.

FADE OUT.
