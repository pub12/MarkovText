TEASER

C.J. [VO]
[through reporters' clamor] Please, I can only answer 14 or 15 questions at once. 
Steve, then Michael.

FADE IN: INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
C.J. is standing at the podium.

STEVE
Has there been any discussion of a Special Prosecutor?

C.J.
Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General to appoint a Special 
Prosecutor, yes. [Reporters clamor.] I... I can't see! Joan?

JOAN
Can you tell us how that will work?

C.J.
A list of three prosecutors is given to a three judge panel. The prosecutors, as well 
as the judges, were all appointed by Republican Presidents.

REPORTER
How soon do you anticipate witnesses being called?

C.J.
I don't know.

REPORTER
Any idea who will be on the witness list?

C.J.
I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, I imagine subpoenas will be issued 
to most senior White House staff, including myself.

FEMALE REPORTER
What about Congress?

C.J.
I'm sorry?

FEMALE REPORTER
Will Congress be holding hearings?

C.J.
I would imagine.

REPORTER 2
Do you know which Committee would have Jurisdiction over...

C.J.
Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearing Congress has in mind; I'm sure there'll 
be one, but you'll have to talk to Congress. [Carol nods at her.] Okay, here now, the 
President of the United States. 

Bartlet walks to the podium. As C.J. steps down, she whispers to him.

C.J.
Front row, on your right.

Cameras flash as Bartlet steps up. 

BARTLET
Yes, Sandy.

SANDY
Mr. President, can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?

BARTLET
I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a little bit of noise there, can you repeat the question?

SANDY
Yes, sir, can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?

BARTLET 
[puts hands in pockets, looks away, smiles] Yeah. And I'm going to win.

FADE TO: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
C.J. is sitting in the back of a limousine.

DRIVER
C.J.... C.J.... C.J.!

C.J. 
Yeah.

DRIVER
We're here.

C.J.
Oh, yeah, thank you, thanks. 

FOUR WEEKS LATER
ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE

C.J. gets out tiredly. The driver hands her a bag, and she walks to the plane.
In a MOVING SHOT, Bartlet climbs out of another limo. BRUNO GIANELLI approaches.

BRUNO GIANELLI
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Bruno!

BRUNO
I've got a new section...

BARTLET
Give it to Leo. 

He walks off, as Bruno sighs in frustration, then follows. We shift to C.J. walking.

PAULSON [OS]
C.J.!

C.J. [OS]
The speech is written, they're just ironing a few things out.

PAULSON
Look...

C.J.
It's written.

PAULSON
I'm not talking about the speech.

C.J.
What?

PAULSON
I've got a source that says the FDA is going to pull the trigger on mifepristone.

C.J.
Mifepristone's...

PAULSON
RU-486.

C.J.
The FDA is an independent agency, I could get in trouble for even knowing what you just 
told me.

PAULSON:
No, it's non-proprietary information delivered by a non-governmental person. You'll be 
fine!

C.J.
Well, I'll be asking one of my 14 lawyers about that. When are they going to announce?

PAULSON
That's the thing. They're doing it on Monday.

C.J.
Monday?

PAULSON
Right before the speech.

C.J. 
[beat] Okay, thanks. 

Paulson leaves as C.J. walks up the steps to the plane. Josh follows.

JOSH 
C.J.! There are now seven different drafts of the speech.

C.J.
Yeah.

JOSH
The President likes none of them. Toby and Doug can't get together, Sam and Doug can't 
get together. Leo and Bruno can't get together.

C.J.
Listen, I've got to talk to you for a second.

JOSH
If anyone asks, the speech is done, they're just ironing it a bit...

They enter the main floor of AIR FORCE ONE.

C.J.
That's what I've been saying. Listen. 

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Come here. 

They walk into an office.

C.J.
Paulson got it from a source the FDA is signing off on RU-486.

JOSH
When are they going to announce?

C.J.
On Monday.

JOSH 
[yells] Come on!

C.J.
Right before the speech.

JOSH
You didn't take care of this?

C.J.
Josh...

JOSH
Damn it, C.J.!

C.J.
I told all departments no news on Monday. We get the cycle to ourselves. 

JOSH
Then how?

C.J.
The FDA is an independent agency.

JOSH
So we're kicking off our campaign on the same day...

C.J.
Yeah.

JOSH
Perfect.

C.J.
Look, I'm sorry, but...

JOSH
Yeah, I'm also not wild about pictures of the President getting on the plane without his 
wife.

C.J.
I can't computer-generate images of the First Lady.

JOSH
She's getting in in the morning?

C.J.
We'll do some pictures.

JOSH
I'm going to call Gail Trent and confirm this other thing. [walks up the steps] Maybe we 
want to postpone.

C.J.
Why?

JOSH 
[irritated] I don't know. He's got laryngitis or something.

C.J. walks on. DOUGLAS WEGLAND catches up with her.

DOUG WEGLAND
C.J..

C.J.
Listen, anybody asks - the speech is done, we're just putting on some...

DOUG
Yeah, listen. What's Toby's problem with me?

C.J.
What do you mean?

DOUG
He's got a problem with me and I'd like to understand the nature of it.

C.J. 
[stops] I wouldn't worry about it.

DOUG
I do worry about it, 'cause I have a job to do this week and he's making it harder.

C.J.
I don't... Connie! 

She walks away to meet CONNIE TATE.

CONNIE TATE
The place has a communications center, a conference room, an operating room, offices, 
and an apartment - this is a nice ride.

C.J.
Yeah. Anybody asks - the speech is done, we're just putting finishing touches on.

CONNIE
Yeah.

C.J.
Thank you.

CONNIE 
[holds up a small box] M&Ms with the Seal of the President.

C.J. walks through the area where reporters are seating themselves.

FEMALE REPORTER 1
C.J., when do we see an advance?

C.J.
Very soon.

MALE REPORTER
The speech is done?

C.J.
It's done, they're just ironing a few things out. 

FEMALE REPORTER 2
Toby and Sam don't have any problem with Bruno's people?

C.J.
Everybody's getting along great, they're dotting the I's and crossing the T's.

Across a hall from her, a door opens and Sam bursts out with a copy of the speech.

SAM
This thing reads like an Andy Williams special. We're starting all over again with a 
white piece of paper! [throws the speech up in the air and walks away]

C.J. 
[turns to reporters] I'm going to take my seat now. [walks off]

Signal beeping. C.J. sits in her chair and buckles in.

PILOT [via P.A.]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. From the flight deck, this is Lieutenant Colonel 
Gantry. We're closing our cabin doors and we ask that you be seated in preparation for 
takeoff. We'll be flying at a cruising altitude of 35,000 ft and our flight path will 
take us over Hartford, Connecticut, Springfield, Massachusetts, and our flight time to 
Pease Base Air Force, New Hampshire, will be approximately one hour and ten minutes, 
and we anticipate a smooth ride.

C.J. chuckles.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
A view of the fountain entrance of the White House.

SANDY [VO]
...now, if you'll be seeking a second term? 

CUT TO: INT. RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS
A television is on in one of the rooms. It's showing Bartlet Press Conference Earlier 
Tonight.

BARTLET [on TV]
Yeah. And I'm going to win.

ANCHOR
That announcement, coming about fifteen minutes ago, was made on the heels of the 
President's stunning disclosure that he'd been diagnosed...

Bartlet walks in past the T.V., opens the doors inside. Another T.V. with the same 
programming on can be seen. Abbey is sitting in a chair with a glass in her hand.

BARTLET
Abbey?

ABBEY [VO]
Jed?

BARTLET
Listen.

ABBEY 
You missed it. It was incredible.

BARTLET
Look...

ABBEY 
[sips wine] All over the news. This crazy man got in front of millions of people and 
totally screwed his wife.

BARTLET
That's funny, 'cause that's sort of what I did.

ABBEY
You can't think this is funny.

BARTLET
I don't.

ABBEY
You can't think this is a joke.

BARTLET 
[turns off T.V.] I don't, I swear.

ABBEY
There are ways of getting out of this. 

BARTLET
Yeah?

ABBEY
You buried Dolores Landingham this afternoon. You couldn't possibly be expected to make...

BARTLET
Are you going...

ABBEY
You let some time go by, a few weeks. You say you've consulted with your doctors, you've 
consulted with your family...

BARTLET
Abbey...

ABBEY
Which, amazingly, people would believe... And then you say you decided...

BARTLET
I'm running again, Abbey.

ABBEY 
[beat] Yeah?

BARTLET
Look, I have a lot to say...

ABBEY
You and me both. Go ahead. 

BARTLET
What?

ABBEY
Say what you have to say.

BARTLET
No, I have to go down, they're going to brief me on the evacuation plan for Haiti.

ABBEY
All right.

BARTLET
You'll be up later?

ABBEY
When?

BARTLET
Probably three or four.

ABBEY
Am I usually up at three or four in the morning?

BARTLET
Not usually.

ABBEY
Then let's assume I won't be tonight.

Bartlet leaves the room.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT 
Josh storms in.

JOSH 
[screaming] Donna!

DONNA 
[runs towards him, then follows him] Where have you been?

JOSH
The motorcade left without me. I had to drive back with Ed and Larry.

DONNA
They couldn't drive faster?

JOSH
Not faster than the Presidential motorcade, no. [goes into his office to leave his coat 
as Donna sorts through his messages] Uh, set up a conference call so Cabinet Affairs can 
brief.

DONNA
You want the sub-cabinet, too?

JOSH
Yeah. I need congressional leaders. [walks out of the office, picks up messages] 

DONNA
Have you ever seen anything like this?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
I'm pumped.

JOSH
Me, too.

DONNA
I'm monumentally pumped.

JOSH
Set up the calls, would you? [walks off]

Donna heads back to Josh's office, then turns and walks into her own area.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Toby walks in from the rain. Josh catches up with him.

JOSH
Toby.

TOBY
Leo's got to... uh, cancel everything on the public schedule tomorrow.

JOSH
Done.

TOBY
You are talking with Cabinet Affairs?

JOSH
Donna is setting up the call. Why aren't you smiling?

TOBY
I'm wet.

JOSH
I'm wet and I'm smiling.

TOBY
I'm smiling on the inside. Ginger?

GINGER [OS]
Yeah!

They walk into the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

TOBY
Public Liaison wrote up talking points two hours ago. Pull them, they're no good anymore. 
[walks into his office]

GINGER
When are they going to have new ones?

SAM
[walks into his office] Public Liaison?

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
[comes out of the office] Half an hour!

TOBY 
[as Sam speaks] Fifteen minutes! Sam, we've got to...

SAM
[at the same time] You'd better...

BOTH
...call the networks and make sure we've got one of our people in every single broadcast 
tonight.

TOBY
Okay, let's try not to do that a lot. [walks off]

SAM
[grins, to Josh] Why isn't he smiling?

JOSH
On the inside. 

SAM
We've got to round up the medical experts for the morning shows and we need to divvy up 
the columnists. Nancy? [walks off, Nancy follows him]

NANCY
Yeah.

SAM
I need to see C.J. as soon as she's free.

NANCY
She's going to be down there for another couple of hours. She's surrounded.

SAM
Well, get her on the phone. [walks off]

NANCY
Yeah. [walks off]

TOBY 
[to Josh, who's following him] And we need Oliver Babish.

JOSH
You want to put him in the Briefing Room tomorrow?

TOBY
Send a message we're not worried about the legal side.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is at his desk, reading. Sam, Toby and Josh walk in and stand there silently 
before him, as he reads without noticing them. Silence. The rain pours outside.

BARTLET 
[raises his head] What are you all looking at?

TOBY
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
What do you guys think the news is going to lead with tomorrow?

LEO
[walks in] Sir.

BARTLET 
[chuckles] Yeah. 

He gets up and leaves with Leo.

SAM 
[to Josh] Haiti?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
All right. Don't worry about Haiti. Let's do what we have to. 

They all walk out.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Nancy is at the head of the table filled with officers.

NANCY
Mike, is that the four AV-8s?

MIKE
Yeah, and four AV-1s.

BARTLET 
[walks in with Leo] Good evening!

NANCY 
[as everyone stands and repeats] Good evening, Mr President. Mr. President, this is 
operation Swift Fury. 

Bartlet sits. Everyone else does. Nancy remains standing.

BARTLET
Yeah.

NANCY
On your command, we deploy a Landingship Helicopter Assault to evacuate both the 
Americans and Dessaline from the embassy. [sits]

LEO
What's in the LHA?

OFFICER
Four CH53Es with 35 troops for combat assault support and eight CH46 helicopters.

LEO
That's for cargo and ammunition?

MIKE
Yeah, we also have four Cobras, two Hueys for command and control, and four Harriers.

LEO
Where do you launch?

MIKE
There's a soccer stadium there.

NANCY
The Stade Alain Toussaint.

MIKE
It's about a quarter mile from the embassy.

BARTLET
So these helicopters land on the roof, and then...

NANCY
...and then take the Americans and Dessaline to the Enterprise.

OFFICER
Code word "Paris" for this operation. 

BARTLET
What are the possibilities there'll be Haitian civilian casualties?

NANCY
A curfew's been imposed and Signal Sntelligence Flights say there aren't any civilians 
within a two-block radius.

BARTLET
How long do I have?

OFFICER
"Paris" will be in place in two hours, sir.

BARTLET
OK. Thank you.

NANCY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Everyone applauds as Bartlet leaves the room.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESENT
Bruno walks down the stairs to Margaret.

BRUNO
Hey! Red-headed girl!

MARGARET 
[with dignity] Margaret.

BRUNO 
[shrugs] Okay. Uh, uh, I need to see him.

MARGARET
He's in his cabin. You can go back.

Bruno walks away as Margaret heads her way, turning back to look at him.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS
Knocking on the door.

LEO
Yeah!

BRUNO 
[walks in] Listen...

LEO
Bruno...

BRUNO
In four weeks...

LEO
Look...

BRUNO
Hang on. Four weeks...

LEO
No, I don't think I will hand on. Who told Doug to write a draft?

BRUNO
This was... this was simply in order to...

LEO
Who told him?

BRUNO
I told him to do it.

LEO
It's got an apology. Also, it stinks. [gets up, walks to the illuminator. Bruno follows.]

BRUNO
Yeah. Okay, it lacks a certain, well, quality...

LEO
Yeah.

BRUNO
But look, Doug isn't here to write poetry. The purpose of this draft is to demonstrate 
that an apology can work.

LEO
He's not going to apologize.

BRUNO
Why not?

LEO
Because it's his official campaign announcement and not Oprah Winfrey.

BRUNO
Doing Oprah wouldn't kill him. 

LEO 
I honestly believe it might. [walks out, Bruno follows]

BRUNO
In four weeks...

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is sitting in her chair. Bruno and Leo walk past her.

LEO
In four weeks, he has made a full disclosure of his health. He's educated the public 
about MS, he's done this every day. He has done everything...

BRUNO
Except apologize. In four weeks, he has saved Haiti for democracy, funded the Justice 
Department Tobacco lawsuit, watched the market rebound... he has done everything but 
apologize.

LEO 
[walks into another cabin] You think he apologizes and his numbers go up?

BRUNO
I think you brought me in two weeks ago because they haven't yet.

LEO 
They have.

BRUNO
Two points in a month? [Leo looks away] If he runs for reelection 27 years from now, 
he's got a fighting chance.

LEO
I've got to make calls. Talk to me about this in town. 

He closes the door as Bruno walks off.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

COLONEL GANTRY [via P.A.] 
This is Colonel Gantry. We're making our final approach to Pease Air Force Base. If you 
would all take your seats and fasten your seat belts.

JOSH 
[walks up to C.J., who is sitting] Listen.

C.J. 
Sit down. We're landing.

JOSH 
I talked to Gail Trent.

C.J. 
And?

JOSH 
And she confirmed it. The FDA's going to announce.

C.J. 
On Monday?

JOSH 
Yeah. What are they talking about back there?

C.J. 
Leo and Bruno?

JOSH 
Yeah.

C.J. 
The lack of yeast in our numbers. Yeast is a fun word to say.

JOSH 
I'm sorry I got in your face before.

C.J. 
Our numbers are less than yeasty.

JOSH 
They are.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
White House staffers are gathered in the room.

TOBY 
We need a new poll in the field right now.

JOSH 
Yeah?

SAM 
I'll tell you why.

JOSH 
Because the first one was bogus.

SAM 
Totally bogus. And I'll tell you why.

C.J. 
1,170 voters in one industrial state isn't representative of the whole country.

JOSH 
Plus, people respond differently to voting out the governor versus a sitting President.

ED
Governors are expendable.

LARRY
While if they feel the country's on the right track, they want to keep the President in 
charge.

SAM 
In charge, if at all possible and I'll tell you what else... 

LARRY
Bartlet's always scored high...

SAM 
Always scored high on the trustworthy scale. 

C.J. 
So he has a bit of a shield to protect him from character attacks.

SAM 
Yes, he does. Not to mention that the information presented during the interview informed 
the public that MS isn't a fatal disease.

C.J. 
We need to put a poll in the field right now.

TOBY 
Than you all for coming around to the self-evident point I made five minutes ago.

Kenny and Joey enter the cafeteria. They are soaking wet.

JOEY [KENNY] 
We've gotta put another poll in the field.

JOSH 
What happened?

JOEY [KENNY]
My ride left without me.

JOSH 
Mine, too. I got a ride with Larry and Ed.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes. Didn't you see me jumping up and down waving my hands in the air?

JOSH 
I just thought you were happy.

LARRY
Me, too.

JOEY
You're an idiot!

JOSH 
Which one of us are you talking to?

JOEY [KENNY]
Listen to me. He did incredibly well on TV tonight. We've gotta put another poll in the 
field.

JOSH 
We know.

JOEY [KENNY]
There's a difference between a governor and a President.

SAM 
Yes.

JOEY [KENNY]
1,170 people in Michigan won't give you a good sample.

TOBY 
[getting up] This is a lot like DuPont Circle.

JOSH 
We're there already, Jo.

JOEY
I was stuck in the rain.

JOSH 
Put a poll in the field.

Kenny signs to her, and they leave.

CUT TO: EXT. MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE - NIGHT 
Josh and Donna are in a car.

JOSH 
The hotel's up on the right.

DONNA
What's mifepristone?

JOSH 
A pill that will abort a pregnancy up to 49 days.

DONNA 
Mifepristone is RU-486?

JOSH 
Yes.

DONNA 
And the FDA's approving it?

JOSH 
Yes.

DONNA 
[singing] Hallelujah! [pulls the car over]

JOSH 
See, I think you're thinking that somehow this pill means more sex for you.

DONNA
No, I'm thinking it's a terrific medical advancement for women. You didn't think I'd be 
for it?

JOSH 
Of course, you're for it. I'm for it. Everybody's for it. Just not on Monday.

DONNA 
[gets out of car] Why not?

JOSH 
[gets out of car] A, it will get folded into our news cycle when we want it to ourselves. 
B, it will give the pro-lifers something to scream about. And C, it'll look like the 
campaign screwed up, so the press'll write a process story instead of writing about our 
issues.

DONNA
Isn't this one of our issues?

JOSH 
Not on Monday. I'm checking in. 

He turns and walks inside the hotel.

Donna 
[sarcastically] Sure, I'll get the bags.

CUT TO: INT. BAR - NIGHT
Doug sits at a bar in New Hampshire.

BARTENDER
What do you need?

DOUG
Absolut martini on the rocks.

BARTENDER 
Olives?

DOUG
Thank you. Is it always this crowded in here?

BARTENDER
Only when the circus is in town. 

Toby walks up to the bar.

BARTENDER
Toby Ziegler! What'd you bring me?

TOBY 
M&Ms from Air Force One, Lois.

BARTENDER
Thank you. [takes the M&Ms] Jack Daniels?

TOBY
Yes, thank you.

DOUG 
[to Toby] Did you...

TOBY 
I read it, yes.

DOUG
It was just to demonstrate that an apology could work.

TOBY 
He's not going to apologize.

DOUG 
What about the rest of the speech?

TOBY 
We're starting over.

Doug 
[moves closer to Toby] Toby, if he doesn't apologize by Monday, we're going to spend the 
next 15 months being asked why. Then when he does, it's going to be because he had to. 
There are moments and when they are missed...

TOBY 
I've done this before.

DOUG
Like Haiti...

TOBY 
Don't talk about military strategy in a conversation like this.

DOUG 
I'm just saying if the table had been set right and he'd been able to invade...

TOBY 
[gesturing with a wave of his hand] You wanna speak up? I'm not sure the entire White 
House Press Corps heard you.

BARTENDER
[puts drink on bar in front of Toby] Jack Daniels.

TOBY 
[gets up] Thank you. [walks away]

BARTENDER
You guys friends?

DOUG
[sighs] Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
Toby walks in.

TOBY 
Is he in?

MARGARET
He's waiting for you. 

Toby walks into LEO'S OFFICE.

LEO
Hey.

TOBY 
Joey's putting a poll in the field first thing in the morning.

LEO
Good. That first poll was bogus and I'll tell you why. 1,170 people in Michigan can't 
possibly...

TOBY 
Leo, Leo, we've been through this.

LEO
Alright. Well, good.

TOBY 
Where's the President?

LEO
In the residence.

TOBY 
How's the first lady?

LEO
You know, I think with everything on our plates, we don't really need to be marriage 
counselors.

TOBY 
[sarcastically] No, we should, 'cause you and I would be good at it. [leaves]

MARGARET 
[enters] Excuse me.

LEO
They're ready?

MARGARET
Yeah. [leaves]

LEO
Here we go. [leaves]

C.J. 
Our hotel is located just a few miles from the site of John Goffe's mill. [reading from 
a brochure] "Hunter John, as he was called, was granted the land as a reward for his 
services to the colony in the French and Indian wars." Let me tell you something. We 
don't do that enough anymore.

SAM 
[reading from his notepad] "I seek re-election to the presidency, not because of it's 
glories but because of its difficulties." [pause] Challenges, right? Challenges is better 
than difficulties.

C.J. 
Yes. [reading] "Later in life, he built the water-powered grist mill with his son, 
Colonel John Goffe, and his grandson, Major John Goffe." The Goffes.

SAM 
Is "challenges" gonna make us think that one of the difficulties is that he got MS?

C.J. 
It's going to make us think he's up for challenges.

SAM 
I agree.

TOBY 
[walks up to table] C.J.?

C.J. 
Yeah?

TOBY 
Wanna play some pool?

C.J. 
I don't know how to play pool.

TOBY 
Then you wanna play for money?

C.J. 
Sure. [gets up]

TOBY 
[as they walk up a ramp to the pool tables] What are you doing?

C.J. 
I'm drawing inspiration from the strength of the Goffe family. The descendents of Hunter 
John have been owners and operators of the Goffe Family Mill for more than two centuries 
now. [reading] "In 1845, when Theodore `Ody' Goffe was the proprietor, the mill burned to 
the ground." Well, that totally blows.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
C.J. is handling a rowdy press corps.

REPORTERS
C.J.!

C.J. 
Again, I can tell you that the operation was launched from the deck of the USS 
Enterprise, about 60 miles off the coast of Haiti. If you need more details about 
troops and equipment, I'm going to have to refer you to the Pentagon.

REPORTERS
[raise hands] C.J.! [C.J. points to Carl]

CARL 
Getting back to last night, for a second, the President was briefed on the evacuation 
after the press conference?

C.J. 
That's right.

CARL
Can you talk about his state of mind?

C.J. 
His state of mind was he's commander in chief.

MARK
I think the question was - was he physically and emotionally prepared to make a 
life-and-death decision after what he'd just been through?

C.J. 
He'd been through a TV. interview and a press conference. The President finds you all 
annoying but not prohibitively debilitating.

REPORTERS
[raising hands] C.J.!

C.J. 
Chris.

MARK 
[interrupting] Excuse me! The President had just announced an elaborate plot to conceal 
a life-threatening illness from the American people.

C.J. 
The President's MS isn't life threatening...

MARK 
So it had no affect...

C.J. 
[firmly] And there was no plot. [points] Steve.

STEVE
When did the President tell you about his condition?

C.J. 
Sorry?

STEVE
When did...

C.J. 
He told me a week ago.

CHRIS
Did the President tell you himself?

C.J. 
No. Leo McGarry told me.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
Josh is watching C.J. on the monitor from the bullpen.

CHRIS
Why didn't the President tell you?

C.J. 
Because Leo McGarry told me.

KATIE
C.J., could you describe your relationship with the President?

Joey and Kenny enter the bullpen.

C.J. 
Just good friends, Katie.

JOEY [KENNY]
How's she doing?

JOSH 
It's getting away from her a little.

C.J. 
[over the monitors] I'm not answering that.

JOEY [KENNY]
They're making her the story.

JOSH 
[stands up] Yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you about something.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yeah?

JOSH 
The Justice Department wants another $30 million to fund its suit against the tobacco 
companies and we want them to have it. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State 
and Commerce handles that money and they won't bring it to a vote.

JOEY [KENNY]
Kalmbach's the chairman?

JOSH 
Yeah. Now, I wanted to turn the heat up and issue a release.

JOEY [KENNY]
Incendiary?

JOSH 
Yeah. It calls them well-fed members lining their campaign war chests and being complicit 
in hundreds of thousands of negligent homicide.

JOEY 
[sarcastic] Nice.

JOSH 
We didn't send the release out yesterday because of the MS announcement and Mrs. 
Landingham. But in a day or two, I wanna leak it. What do you think?

JOEY
Yeah, that's really stupid.

JOSH 
Why?

JOEY [KENNY]
Because offense makes people play defense.

JOSH 
I'm raising the profile to bring public opinion down on him. Play defense with that.

JOEY [KENNY]
Congress appropriates the money. You're not going to get it by pissing off the 
appropriators.

JOSH 
Watch me.

JOEY [KENNY]
Thanks for asking my opinion.

JOSH 
No sweat. [looks at monitor]

C.J. [on monitor] 
I'm not going to answer that.

CARL
Is it because you don't know?

C.J. 
It's because I don't believe it has anything to do with the President's sharing his 
health information with the general public.

JOSH 
[overlapping] Let's get away from it. [walks out of the bullpen with Joey and Kenny.]

CARL
Hang on. You're supposed to be able to distinguish between the things we're supposed to 
know and the things we're supposed to know and you don't.

C.J. 
[sighs] The Pentagon briefing's scheduled for 3 this afternoon. I'll keep you posted with 
the changes.

REPORTERS
[raise hands] C.J.! 

C.J. holds her hands in front of her in a stop signal.

CUT TO: INT. BAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE - PRESENT

TOBY 
[takes a shot on the pool table] Leo talked to me, you know.

C.J. 
Hmm?

TOBY 
I said Leo talked to me.

C.J. 
Yeah?

TOBY 
[looks at her pointedly] Yeah.

C.J. 
About what?

TOBY 
[pauses and then shoots again] Your shot.

C.J. 
[rolls ball into the hole with her hand] Strategically, I felt that was the wise thing 
to do.

TOBY 
Leo talked to me. I know what you're thinking about doing.

C.J. rolls another ball into the hole and looks at Toby.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
Bartlet walks in. A few people are in his office.

NANCY [VO]
Good morning, Mr. President.

JOSH [VO]
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
We're talking about a display of force?

NANCY
Yes, sir. Bazan sees what he's up against.

BARTLET
And what is he up against?

MOSLEY
We can buzz Port-au-Prince with an Alpha strike formation. Five F-18 types.

NANCY
It'll get his attention. [Everyone sits.]

JOSH
Isn't it possible they can shoot at us again?

MILITARY OFFICER
We'll fly an E-2 Hawkeye with a radar dome.

BARTLET
It picks up weapons signals?

MILITARY OFFICER
Yes, sir. We'd know before the formation reached Port-Au-Prince if they were in danger.

BARTLET 
[nods, opens file] Peter, State's exploring the effectiveness of immediate sanctions?

PETER
Yeah, we're exploring it, but we've been down that road with Haiti before. 

JOSH
With terrible results that hurt the wrong people.

NANCY
And not to pile it on, Mr. President, but we have reports of 12 separate incidents of 
cutters intercepting Haitians off the Florida Keys. If we stretch out the resolution, 
then...

BARTLET
We'll have a refugee crisis.

NANCY
Guantanamo Bay.

BARTLET 
[beat] All right, let's go here. Nancy, Peter, get a message to the Canadian prime 
minister - we intend to restore Dessaline. The Canadians should tell Bazan if he doesn't 
move out we're willing to move forward with military options. In the mean time, I'm 
willing to consider a fly-by.

NANCY
If the fly-by doesn't work?

BARTLET
Now you're just bugging me. [sighs] That's all.

EVERYONE 
[standing] Thank you, Mr. President.

Everyone leaves, Josh and Toby remain behind. Bartlet goes to his desk.

JOSH
Sir...

BARTLET
Yeah?

JOSH
We should bear in mind that if we end up invading Haiti there'll be a belief...

BARTLET
That it was politically motivated.

TOBY
Yeah. That at the... at the very least we welcomed the opportunity both to distract 
attention from the MS story and show strength as commander in chief.

BARTLET
You think it's a sign of strength to invade Haiti? 

JOSH
I meant...

BARTLET
Missouri could invade Haiti.

JOSH
Yes.

BARTLET
Sanctions aren't going to work - you said it yourself. The Haitian National Police will 
get rich of the contraband. Dessaline was democratically elected and instead of sitting 
in his office he's sitting on the USS Enterprise. To say nothing of the fact that they 
shot at us, and you don't get to do that.

TOBY
Sir...

BARTLET
I'm late. 

He picks up papers and walks out. Josh and Toby remain behind.

TOBY
Everybody's tired.

JOSH
You know, at some point we're going to have to check the First Lady's temperature.

TOBY
Okay, you first.

JOSH 
[smirks] Yeah.

TOBY
On Haiti, tell your people to be careful with public posture - not to say or do anything 
that could taint any of the options.

JOSH
Nobody wants to invade...

TOBY
Nobody wants to contemplate invading until we've exhausted diplomatic options.

JOSH
Yeah.

They both lean on the desk and stay silent.

CUT TO: INT. BAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE - PRESENT
Charlie is walking up to the pool table with a beer bottle.

TOBY
Charlie!

CHARLIE
Yeah.

TOBY
You want to play?

CHARLIE
Aren't you supposed to be writing?

TOBY
I am writing.

CHARLIE
I don't see paper.

Toby walks up to him and sits down.

TOBY
"We can sit back and admit with grave sensitivity that life isn't fair and the 
less-advantaged are destined to their lot in life and the problems of those on the 
other side of the world should stay there, that our leaders are cynical and can never 
be an instrument to change, but that, my friends, is not worthy of you, it's not worthy 
of the President, it's not worthy of a great nation, it's not worthy of America!" Paper's 
for wimps. Wanna play?

CHARLIE
No.

TOBY
I understand it's because you're scared.

CHARLIE
I'm not.

TOBY
I'm saying if you're a scared chicken, I understand.

CHARLIE 
[walks up to him] You got twenty bucks?

TOBY
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Put it on the table.

Toby pulls out some money and places it on the table. So does Charlie.

TOBY
I'll give you the break.

CHARLIE 
[goes to break] If you give me the break, you're not gonna need that stick. [breaks]

CUT TO: OUTER OVAL OFFICE - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
Oliver Babish comes up to Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

OLIVER
Can I see you for a second?

Charlie follows Babish away from his desk. Oliver closes the doors to THE MURAL ROOM.

OLIVER
Today, the President is going to direct the Attorney General to appoint a Special 
Prosecutor.

CHARLIE
Yes.

OLIVER
Now, you know what that means, right?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

OLIVER
Okay, so you'll need a lawyer.

CHARLIE
Actually, Mr. Babish, I don't think I need one.

OLIVER
You do.

CHARLIE
I think I'll be fine.

OLIVER
Really?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

OLIVER 
[sits down] He's going to ask you about everything you'd seen and heard since you started 
working at the White House.

CHARLIE
I can answer those questions truthfully.

OLIVER
Then he's going to call you back a month later and ask you the exact same questions. If 
your answers change even a little bit, he'll prosecute you for perjury.

CHARLIE
Mr. Babish...

OLIVER
Oliver's fine. Are you prepared to describe every conversation you've ever had with the 
President? Whether he asked you for an aspirin? Whether his hands quivered? Are you 
prepared to answer questions about your relationship with his youngest daughter? This is 
NFL football.

CHARLIE
When is this all going to happen?

OLIVER
I don't know.

CHARLIE 
[sits down] How can you not know?

OLIVER
Because grand jury investigations are secret.

CHARLIE
So they can just knock on my door one morning?

OLIVER
They will knock on your door one morning.

CHARLIE
How much? You know, how much do you think...

OLIVER
Assuming you did nothing wrong, saw nothing wrong and heard nothing wrong - about a 
hundred thousand dollars.

TOBY
Sorry.

CHARLIE

I can't do the job if he thinks he's got to send me out of the room every time...

TOBY
No, you're right. You know what? Look, it's a typical marriage, I've been there.

CHARLIE
Well, I haven't, but he's the President of the United States, so my guess is no, it's 
probably not a typical marriage. I'll see you later. [walks off]

Toby sits on the table and rolls a ball in the hole.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. BAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE - NIGHT
The bar is very dark, illuminated by strings of lights here and there. A few customers 
and bar staff remain. Music is playing softly. In one corner, seated around a table, are 
Josh, Donna, Connie, and Margaret. Connie and Margaret are reading. Donna is eating food 
off of Josh's plate while she reads a newspaper.

JOSH
I said to you, I said this - I said: "Do you want food?"

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
And you said, "No, I don't want any food."

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
And now, you're eating my food.

DONNA
You'd kind of think you'd have learned it by now.

JOSH
Are you...eating the rest of the sandwich?

DONNA
Are you?

Josh looks mildly annoyed and takes a large bite out of the sandwich. Bruno walks over.

BRUNO
Where is he?

JOSH 
[mouth full of food] How you doing?

BRUNO
I don't care. Where is he?

MARGARET 
[a little testily] Leo's on the phone.

JOSH
What's the problem?

Bruno sighs and sits down next to Josh. He opens a file folder and reads from a document.

BRUNO
"Our economy may be stronger, yet there are Americans who work longer for less pay and 
less dignity. Our crops may feed the world, yet there are children whose stomachs ache 
with the pain of hunger." [sarcastically] Yes, it's midnight in America.

JOSH
I'm not sure you can say "stomachs ache with the pain."

CONNIE
You can, but it's bad. Bruno, I ran into Sam before.

BRUNO
And?

CONNIE
We'll talk tomorrow... Does anybody know if the kitchen's still open?

DONNA
I'm not eating this potato salad. [starts to hand it to Connie]

JOSH 
[grabbing the bowl from Donna] I'm eating it. 

Doug walks in, looking determined.

DOUG
Bruno.

BRUNO
I know, I know.

DOUG 
[reading] "Let us shine a light on dark places in America: places where all hope has been 
banished, places where our founders' dreams are yet to be redeemed."

BRUNO
And then let us kill ourselves and move to Pakistan.

Doug tosses the speech on the table. Leo walks in.

LEO
Why are people here? 

BRUNO
Leo.

LEO
I came to the bar to have some privacy.

BRUNO
Leo, I'm reading things that would make the cast of Up With People sit down on the floor 
and cry.

LEO 
[gruffly] We'll work tomorrow. [to Connie and Doug] What are you two doing here?

CONNIE
We were...

LEO
Tomorrow.

Leo puts a bunch of bills down on the table next to Josh, presumably for the food, and 
starts to walk away. Josh takes quick swig of beer, stands up and follows Leo toward the 
front door of the bar.

JOSH
I need to talk to you... The FDA's gonna approve RU-486.

LEO
How do you know?

JOSH
C.J. had a source.

LEO
You're not supposed to have that information.

JOSH
The source was non-governmental. Leo, they're doing it on Monday.

LEO
You've confirmed it?

JOSH
As well as I can. I've been at it most of the night. I'd like to go through back 
channels, see if I can hold 'em off.

LEO 
[shaking his head] No.

JOSH
Then I think we have to consider postponing the speech. 

They pause next to the bar, facing each other.

LEO
I'm going out to see the President first thing in the morning. Let me talk to him.

JOSH
All right.

LEO
All right.

Leo leaves. Josh stares after him.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
A number of staffers, including Joey, Kenny, Larry, Ed, Josh and Sam, are sitting, 
pacing, and standing around the conference table. They're all reading a report on 
polling data that Joey has prepared.

JOEY [KENNY]
These are hot off the presses.

JOSH
Early numbers?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yeah, these are just preliminary after the first sixteen hours.

SAM 
[reading] "How much faith and confidence do you have in President Bartlet? Great Deal: 
21%, Somewhat: 24%, Only a Little:15%."

LARRY 
[reading] "Not at All: 38%."

SAM
We got 45% in the top two boxes. That's better than we thought. 

JOSH 
[reading] "Do you feel he's physically able to perform his duties as President?"

ED
"Probably Not" and "Definitely Not" at 39%.

JOEY [KENNY]
That number'll go down as we educate the public about MS. 

LARRY 
[nodding] Yeah, with 25% saying they don't know.

JOSH
What's the bottom line?

JOEY [KENNY]
For an incumbent to have any chance at all at this point in the calendar, he needs 40%.

SAM
And if the election were held today?

JOEY
Forty-one.

LARRY 
[reading] "Forty-one percent would re-elect him, 37 would elect a new person."

ED 
[reading] "Twenty-two percent don't know."

SAM
He's in the ball game. 

JOSH
All right, I'm gonna set up some meetings for tomorrow. We'll have the final numbers for 
this set and we'll figure out where to go from here. Thanks everybody.

Josh gets up quickly to leave.

SAM
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah?

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

SAM
Listen, I was talking to Toby earlier.

Ginger walks past them in the opposite direction.

JOSH
Hey, Ginger.

GINGER
Hey.

SAM 
[to Ginger] Hey.

SAM
And I was saying that actually he hasn't apologized.

JOSH
What do you mean? 

SAM
I looked over the transcript and he hasn't apologized.

JOSH
Yeah, well, I don't know what to say.

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Let me ask you something.

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
The release I wrote about the tobacco appropriations...

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
What would you think about my leaking it to the subcommittee? 

They pause in the middle of the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

SAM
I wouldn't do it. 

Josh scowls a little and considers Sam'S comment for a few seconds.

JOSH
I'm doing it. 

Josh turns and keeps walking. Sam walks after him.

SAM
Okay...So you don't think we're gonna get hung with the apology?

JOSH
Hang on.

Josh spots one of the monitors on the wall. C.J. is briefing the press. She's not wearing 
her suit jacket, so presumably this is a later press conference than the one before. 
Josh stops and turns up the volume on another television in one of the cubicles.

REPORTER [on T.V.]
Can you talk about the level of military force you're going to show Bazan?

C.J. [on T.V.]
It'll be what's called an Alpha-strike formation fly-over.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is standing at the podium. She looks very tired. Toby is watching from the office 
area at the back of the room.

C.J.
It's five F-18 fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Steve.

STEVE
The injured Marines - has the President spoken to their families or them yet? 

C.J.
The President's expressed his gratitude and his concern to the Marines and their families.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

FEMALE REPORTER
Did they express any concern for the President or the President's health?

C.J.
No, the President's health isn't a matter of concern. 

The reporters holler a bunch of questions at C.J., none of which she acknowledges. 
She strikes the podium lightly with her palm and continues to respond to the previous 
question, while looking increasingly tense and flustered.

C.J.
The conversation was focused on the Marines and their contribution to our national 
security. 

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Mark.

MARK
There are reports of Coast Guard cutters intercepting Haitians off the Florida Keys?

C.J. 
[checking her notes] Yeah, they're being considered economic refugees and diverted to 
Guantanamo Bay. 

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J. 
[loudly, trying to be heard over the din] Carl.

CARL
Does this mean that the President can't afford to spend his own political capital right 
now by accepting mass numbers of refugees?

C.J.
That's not a factor. 

Toby is looking more and more nervous from his vantage point at the back of the room.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Joan.

Carl asks a follow up question, despite C.J.'s attempt to call on someone else. C.J. 
listens impatiently and a bit wearily to Carl.

CARL
Do you think that the President's political problems make it more or less likely that he 
will order an invasion?

C.J.
Again, that's not a factor. 

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Joan?

CARL
I'm sorry, Joan. C.J., would you say that the President's situation makes it harder for 
him to focus on the situation in Haiti?

Increasingly impatient, C.J. takes off her glasses and tosses them on the podium.

C.J.
To be honest with you, Carl, I think the President's relieved to be focusing on something 
that matters. 

The room is instantly quiet, except for the sound of cameras clicking and flashing. The 
reporters stare at her, astonished. Toby looks stunned, his eyebrows raised and his mouth 
hanging open. It take a moment for C.J. to realize the scope of her blunder. Not looking 
up, tucking her hair behind her ear.

C.J.
Obviously, what I meant to say was...

CARL
Excuse me, did you just say he was relieved?

C.J. 
[still not looking up] Obviously what I...

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! C.J.!

As every reporter in the room is clamoring, C.J. never looks up. Toby turns and leaves 
the room, rubbing his head. He runs into Sam in the HALLWAY. Toby is shaking his head, 
still shocked.

SAM 
[looking sick to his stomach] Toby...

TOBY 
[gesturing, gasping] I don't believe it.

SAM
You saw it?

TOBY
I was standing right there. 

SAM
"He's relieved"...he might have to send troops into battle? 

Toby turns Sam back in the direction of the briefing room exit door. They slowly walk 
toward it as they talk. 

SAM
"He's relieved"...he might have to put American lives at risk and kill Haitian civilians 
'cause it takes his mind off having lied to the electorate?

As they reach the briefing room exit door, the door opens and C.J. walks out into the 
hallway amid the sound of reporters calling out her name. Only half looking up, she takes 
one step in the direction of her office, sees Toby and Sam, and immediately turns to walk 
in the opposite direction so she's not facing them. She looks deflated, not quite steady 
on her feet, and extremely upset. They can see how upset she is, so they hang back.

TOBY 
[gently] C.J...

C.J. stops in a doorway.

C.J. 
[shouting] Just... just don't say anything for a... just don't say anything for a.... 

C.J. puts her hand to her head and sighs heavily, muttering something inaudible to 
herself. Sam looks over at Toby, then back at C.J. None of them make a sound for several 
moments. Then C.J. pounds her hand into the wall. 

C.J.
[shouting] Dammit!

C.J. turns around and walks between Toby and Sam, who say nothing in response to her 
outburst. They still look stunned as they watch her walk off toward her office.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is seated behind his desk. Joey and Kenny are standing up in front of his desk.

JOEY [KENNY]
Tobacco.

LEO
What about it?

JOEY [KENNY]
Josh wants to send the release.

LEO
The press release?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes. It's incendiary. Josh is feeling burned and he's letting his emotions, and dare I 
say ego, drive what I think is a very delicate situation...

Margaret comes in and hands a message to Leo.

LEO 
[raises a hand to stop her] Hang on. 

Leo reads the message quickly, then takes off his glasses turns his head, grimacing.

LEO
Holy hell.

Leo gets up, leaving his glasses on his desk. As he leaves, Kenny signs something for Joey.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Josh is heading quickly towards C.J.'s office, but she storms in there just ahead of him, 
slamming the door with significant force; the sound echoes through the hallway. Josh 
stops abruptly as the door slams. Scowling, he quickly changes direction and sees Toby 
and Sam. They pedeconference in the direction of Leo's office. 

JOSH
"Relieved"? The President's relieved to be focusing on Haiti?

TOBY
I was there.

JOSH
Isn't this exactly what we said we had to be careful of?

Leo comes barreling down the HALLWAY toward them. They all stop and stand in a circle in 
the middle of the hall. A security officer is standing, still and silent, right behind 
Leo. Toby bites his nails. Josh rubs his head in frustration. Sam still looks stunned, 
as does Leo.

LEO
What happened?

JOSH
She was asked if the President's situation makes it harder for him to focus on Haiti. 

SAM 
[defensively] There was a ramp-up.

JOSH
There was a ramp-up but she was asked...

LEO
What did she say?

JOSH
She said the President's relieved to be focusing on something that matters.

LEO
"Relieved"?

Leo turns, fuming and shaking his head, and walks back toward his office. The other 
three follow close behind, debating their options amongst themselves.

TOBY
We can argue that...uh...she just misspoke. 

JOSH
She meant to say that the President realizes he's focusing on something that matters.

TOBY
Or the President's reiterating that his focus is on something...

SAM
I don't like "something that matters," like finding out the President lied doesn't matter.

They all walk into LEO'S OFFICE and keep on talking as Leo methodically and angrily slams 
the door between his office and the Oval Office.

TOBY
She misspoke is all we need. We go back, we say that she misspoke.

Leo slams the main door to his office, startling Josh. Leo turns to look at the other 
three men, who are standing in the middle of the room facing each other. Leo's rage is 
barely contained.

LEO 
[yelling] What if he has to invade? If he invades Haiti after what...[pointing] It's 
gonna look like he ordered a military operation to cover up...

TOBY
She goes back. She says she was tired.

Leo walks over behind his desk. The others stay put. Josh looks especially uncomfortable.

LEO
C.J. doesn't misspeak!

JOSH 
[quietly, firmly] She just did. 

LEO 
[continues to yell] If she misspoke, why didn't she clean it up in the Briefing Room? 
I mean, come to think of it, why didn't she clean it up in the Briefing Room?

SAM
She actually is tired, Leo. We all are.

LEO 
[really angry, sarcastic] Well, why don't we go with that, Sam? Let's go out and say 
we're all tired. The President's tired. Complications due to MS.

Toby and Josh meet each other's gaze, both looking very uncomfortable. Sam tries to 
maintain a non-aggressive tone with Leo.

SAM
We haven't had much time...

LEO 
[sharply] You had a week. How much time do you need?

SAM 
[finally raising his voice, angry] Some of us have had more time than others!

Leo stops cold and stares at Sam. No one speaks for several moments. Toby gazes at the 
ceiling. Josh stares at the wall. Finally, Leo walks across the room and opens the main 
door to his office.

LEO
Margaret?

MARGARET
[appears] Yes, sir?

LEO
Is he alone?

MARGARET
Yeah. 

Leo turns toward Josh, Toby, and Sam. Only Josh looks him in the eye.

LEO
Come up with something.

Leo leaves and goes into the Oval Office.

CUT TO: EXT. DRIVEWAY OF THE BARTLET FAMILY FARM - PRESENT DAY
A black Lincoln drives up a long gravel driveway which is flanked by a wooden fence and 
some trees. Several black SUVs and a few cars are parked along the side of the drive. 
A large white house is barely visible in the distance. The car stops at a guardhouse. 
Leo is sitting in the backseat, with the window rolled down.

GUARD
Good morning, Mr. McGarry. You can go on up. He's out by the pasture.

Leo nods and the car creeps forward up the driveway.

CUT TO: EXT. PASTURE ON BARTLET FAMILY FARM - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is leaning on the back of an old red pickup, wearing jeans and a polo shirt, 
drinking coffee and smoking. He catches sight of Leo's car. Several barns and out 
buildings, as well as farm equipment are visible off to the side. A cow moos in the 
background. Leo's driver pulls the car up close to where Bartlet is standing. Leo gets 
out of the car and walks over toward Bartlet as someone walks two horses up toward the 
house. Leo is wearing khakis and a casual suit jacket.

LEO 
[shaking his head] You live in the middle of nowhere, you know that?

BARTLET
Awasiwi Odanack. It's a Abenaki phrase that means...

LEO 
[a bit impatiently, like he's heard this before] ..."beyond the village."

BARTLET 
[at the same time] ..."beyond the village."

LEO
Yeah. [leans one hand against the side of the truck] Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
You want coffee?

LEO 
[shakes his head] No.

BARTLET
What's happening? 

LEO
C.J.'s got it from a non-governmental source - the FDA's gonna announce their approval 
of RU-486.

Bartlet pauses and nods slightly.

BARTLET
When?

LEO
Monday.

Bartlet takes another drag on his cigarette, stubs it out, and stands up.

BARTLET
Yeah, all right.

Bartlet walks slowly over into the pasture area, his hands in his pockets. Leo waits for 
just a moment and then follows him.

LEO
Why don't we consider postponing the speech?

BARTLET
Why?

LEO
You've got laryngitis.

BARTLET 
[turns around briefly, still walking] Yeah, no, I mean, why?

LEO
It'll get wrapped up in the news...

BARTLET
It'll get wrapped up in one news cycle. I don't give a...

LEO
It will. Plus it gives meat to the right. Lets the press write a process story. Right out 
of the gate the Bartlet campaign is pandering and bumbling and performing abortions in 
the Rose Garden.

Leo finally catches up to Bartlet so that they're walking beside each other.

BARTLET
Screw it, and screw anybody who writes that story.

Leo looks down at the ground for a moment, then continues in a slightly softer tone.

LEO
Plus, I have a hunch the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week.

BARTLET 
[smiles slightly] You have a hunch? 

LEO
Look...

BARTLET
Of course the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week. If we announce in two 
weeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down! [testily] Screw it! 
It's game time. Let's go!

Leo stares at him for a few moments, silent, but continues walking. Bartlet walks ahead 
to a fence that borders a huge expanse of land. 

LEO
This is a nice piece of land. It'd be better without the... floodlights and the metal 
detectors, but...

Bartlet leans against the fence and stares out at the cows grazing near a large pond. 
Finally, Leo walks up to the fence and leans against it, a few feet away from Bartlet, 
and looks out at the land. 

BARTLET
Yeah.

Leo turns, still leaning on the fence, to look at Bartlet.

LEO
Abbey and the girls are getting in this morning?

BARTLET 
[not looking at Leo] Yeah. [finally turns, still leaning on the fence, to face Leo] 
How's everybody doing?

LEO 
[nods] Fine.

BARTLET 
[nods slightly, but looks skeptical] What about C.J.? 

Leo gives Bartlet a knowing look, but doesn't say anything in response. Bartlet glances 
at Leo and gets the message.

BARTLET
All right. [long pause, deep sigh] Laryngitis?

LEO 
[shakes his head slightly] I don't know.

BARTLET
We could just say I have MS.

Leo bows his head a bit and nods a little, acknowledging Bartlet's comment, and gazes off 
into the distance.

LEO
Yeah...

BARTLET
Leo?

LEO
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
I'm running for reelection, and I'm gonna win.

Leo just looks at him. After a few moments, they both turn back to gaze off into the 
distance, still leaning on the fence, saying nothing, side by side.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
