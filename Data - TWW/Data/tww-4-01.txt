TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - DAY

CROWD
Four more years! Four more years!

BARTLET
You know the story about...

CROWD
Four more years! Four more years!

	A 9:55 - MOTORCADE ARRIVED AT CAMPAIGN SITE
	A 10:25 - PRESIDENT CONCLUDED CAMPAIGN EVENT, MOTORCADE DEPARTED FOR UNIONVILLE
	A 10:30 - PHONE-R-SEC HUTCHINSON

BARTLET
There's a guy down here holding a sign that says, "Eight more years." Don't get me wrong, 
I like your thinking, but I've probably tested the Constitution about as far as Abbey's 
going to allow me to for a little while. [Crowd cheers and applauds.] You know the story 
about the guy whose cars gets stuck in a muddy hole. A farmer comes along and says he'll 
pull the car out of the mud but he's going to have to charge 50 bucks 'cause this is the 
tenth time he's had to pull it out of the mud today. The driver says, "God, when to you 
have time to plow your land, at night?" The farmer says, "No, no. Nighttimeis when I fill 
the whole with water." [Crowd laughs.] We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting 
our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying to convince 
us that they care about new energy and that they're not in the vest pockets of big oil, 
and that's a tough sell. I don't envy them, 'cause their only hope is that we don't notice 
that they're the ones who are filling the hole with water every night, and I think Americans 
are smarter then that. I think we noticed. 

While the crowd cheers and applauds, C.J. walks across the stage to Donna who is standing 
off to the side.

C.J.
Where are Josh and Toby?

DONNA
They're in the soybean fields, talking to Cathy.

C.J.
Cathy...?

DONNA
The daughter, but I like saying Toby and Josh are in the soybean fields.

C.J.
He's wrapping up, and we're getting right in the car. We're already late for Unionville.

DONNA
I'll get them from the soybean fields.

C.J.
Thanks.

BARTLET
This isn't a time for people whose doomsday scenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco 
and Shell. This isn't a time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives, just 
because they can't think of any. This is a time for American heros, and we reach for the stars.

Crowd cheers and applauds.

CUT TO: EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY

CATHY 
[indicating Toby] He seems a little tense.

JOSH
Yeah. Yeah.

CATHY
Why?

JOSH
Because the President's speaking.

CATHY
Why aren't you there?

TOBY
It's tough to explain.

JOSH
No, it's not.

TOBY
Shh. Okay.

JOSH
The President has his blood pressure taken every morning. On higher blood pressure days, 
Toby's not allowed to be in the President's sight line while he's speaking.

CATHY
Why?

TOBY
Stepped on it.

JOSH
He has trouble concealing his displeasure.

TOBY
Stepped on it and he knows it, too.

CATHY
Look...

JOSH
What do I say to people who ask why we subsidize farmers when we don't subsidize plumbers?

CATHY
Tell them they can pay $7 for a potato.

JOSH
Okay.

CATHY
This is 200 acres of soy fields. It nets my family $30 an acre, which is $6000 a year.

TOBY
Shh. Okay.

CATHY
Toby...

TOBY
We worked with the Confernce Committee to increase payment limits for small farmers and 
we'd have done it too, but no one could agree what "small" meant.

DONNA
Josh!

JOSH
I think we better head back.

DONNA 
[approaches] He's wrapping up.

CATHY
You seem pissed that I brought it up.

TOBY
No, we're just talking.

DONNA
We really got to go now.

They begin walking back to the campaign site.

JOSH
Donna's a little nervous. A couple of weeks ago, some guys got left behind by the motorcade 
in Kentucky.

DONNA
It was in Tennessee, and they were never heard from again.

JOSH
They took a cab.

CATHY
Look...

JOSH
I think the real point is, whatever Toby and the Conference Committee... Whatever definition they 
came up with would've just created more business for the lawyers for the big farm corporations. 
I wished we could've had more time to talk, but...

CATHY
There's no way you guys could stay a little, meet some people... maybe catch up with the 
campaign at the next stop?

JOSH
Nah, we've got one more stump in Unionville, and then we get on the plane. It's a full schedule 
at the office.

CATHY
We've got some voters here, Josh-- did you forget?

JOSH
No.

TOBY
They're voting for Ritchie.

CATHY
What?

TOBY
Indiana's voting for Ritchie. If there was someone less competent than Ritchie on the ballot, 
that's who Indiana'd be voting for.

CATHY
Why'd you come out here?

TOBY
When somebody can give me an answer to that question, I'll let you know.

CATHY
Listen, write of Indiana, but don't write off the small farmers. It's getting bad out here. 
It is bad out here.

JOSH
We paid farmers $67 billion over the last three years.

CATHY
Oh, God. [walks off ahead of them]

JOSH
[to Toby] You want to lighten up a little?

TOBY
I am lightened up. This is me lightened up. You're saying lighter?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
Okay.

CATHY
Josh... the 67 billion brought this country the least expensive food and the greatest 
variety of it in the world, and surely that's got to register...

DONNA
Hang on.

CATHY
And its got to register...

JOSH
No... she's right. Where is it?

TOBY
Where is it?

JOSH
Where's the motorcade. Hey, excuse me. Where's the motorcade?

WOMAN
[points] It's out there.

They turn around to see the motorcade driving off down the street. Josh throws his arms in the air.

JOSH
Hey! Hey!

WOMAN
You guys need a button? "Bartlet for America."

JOSH
All right, Donna, listen, we got to get the trailer car.

DONNA

JOSH
Call Campaign Scheduling and Advance and tell them...

DONNA
Hang on. [on the phone]

JOSH
You got to hang up with whoever you're tallking to. Call Campaign Sceduling and Advance... 
Unless you're already talking to Campaign Scheduling and Advance.

DONNA
Thank you. [hangs up the phone] There is no trailer car today.

JOSH
Really?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Good budget cut. Good item. Cathy, where's the closets cab?

CATHY
About a 110 ten miles as the crow flies.

JOSH
All right.

DONNA
What's the best way for me to get these guys to Unionville?

CATHY
We'll take you.

JOSH
Really?

CATHY
Yeah. It'll give me a chance to show you the soy diesel car.

JOSH
Okay, this car... it can...

CATHY
It's a regular car.

JOSH
Toby!

CATHY
It's actually Cap's car. He'll come along. Meet us in back of the house. [leaves]

JOSH
Thank you very much. Who's Cap?

DONNA
I don't know.

JOSH
Toby!

TOBY
Yeah?

JOSH
We got a ride.

An elderly woman walks by.

TOBY
Excuse me?

WOMAN
Yes?

TOBY
You heard the speech right?

WOMAN
Oh, Yes.

TOBY
The section on HMO's, did he land it?

WOMAN
I'm sorry?

TOBY
He didn't, did he?

WOMAN
I thought he was very good.

TOBY
The muddy hole joke?

JOSH
Toby.

TOBY
Okay. Thank you.

JOSH
Let's go.

DONNA
Never heard from again, Josh.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

LEO
Tell me again when the President's back.

They go out and walk in the HALLWAYS.

MARGARET
3:00, wheels down.

LEO
What's his first?

MAGARET
Treasurer of the United States, not to be confused with Treasury Secretary.

LEO
The Treasurer of the United States deals with the color of money. What's the meeting about?

MARGARET
Color currency.

LEO
Push it and push his meeting on health and fitness. I want the Trade Rep and as many of the 
economic advisors as we can at the 3:30.

MARGARET
Speaking of health and fitness...

They stop at the top of the stairs.

LEO
Oh, Merciful god.

MARGARET
What did you have?

LEO
I had half a grapefruit.

MARGARET
Really?

LEO
You think I'm lying?

The Situation Room.

LEO
Good morning.

ALL
Good morning, Leo. Good morning.

LEO
The Dow's down 260.

MAN
Is it going to rebound?

LEO
What do I know. Could somebody get me half a grapefruit? I got Jack LaLanne working for me 
this week. Let's go around the table for the quicksheet.

FITZWALLACE
A small force of North Korean soldiers may stage an incursion into the DMZ.

LEO
That's a reaction to the President's trip to Seoul, right?

FITZWALLACE
Yeah.

LEO
Okay. South America?

WOMAN
General Garcia has declared himself in rebellion against Carlos Velasco.

LEO
Is Velasco's governmet in danger, or is this just another crazy general with guns? 
No offense, Fitz.

FITZWALLACE
Yeah.

WOMAN
The Venezuela Desk still says wait'll Garcia calls for the elections.

LEO
Okay. Africa.

MAN
The government of Mozambique is requesting a peacekeeping force to help distribute grain.

LEO
A peacekeeping force to distribute grain.

MAN
Yes, sir.

LEO
Middle East.

MAN 2
Nothing really. We got a communique from the new Ambassador.

LEO
To where?

MAN 2
I'm sorry. Qumar.

LEO
About what?

MAN 2
Well, a month ago, they reopened the investigation into Shareef's missing plane.

LEO
They find anything?

MAN 2
I don't know, but the Emergency Locator Transmitor never went off, so...

LEO
Yeah.

FITZWALLACE
We'll assemble all the military rescue efforts and feed them into State. They can give the 
Ambassador and the Sultan another report. 

LEO
Yeah. All right. Eastern Europe.

Leo and Fitzwallace exchange concerned glances back and forth.

MAN 3
Warsaw transit workers are threatening to go on strike.

MAN
Why?

MAN 3
Well, they haven't been paid in four months.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Ginger is walking through the lobby when she sees Sam enter the building.

GINGER
Whoa, whoa, you're not supposed to be here.

Yeah, I just wanted to check with...

They walk through the hallways to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

GINGER
The orders were very strict.

LEO
Hey.

SAM
I just...

LEO
Go home.

SAM
I am.

LEO
You haven't had a day off since the convention. You've been up the past two nights and 
I don't want a zombie.

SAM
Right.

LEO
The energy book is done; the Midwest poll is out. Pawn off the surrogate movement and get 
a few hours of sleep.

SAM
I just came to check on the Southern Governors. Somebody's got to be watching the politics.

LEO
Somebody is-- the White House Office of Political Affairs.

SAM
Where is he?

LEO
He's about to go on at Ft. Bristol.

SAM
You know the Dow's down 270.

LEO
Go to sleep.

SAM
I'm not fighting with you.

Sam walks into his office.

FADE IN: INT. NAVAL WARFARE CENTER CRANE - DAY
The Presidential motorcade arrives at the Naval Warfare Center Crane. Bartlet is let out 
of the car where he greets the Captain.

BARTLET
Captain, good to see you.

CAPTAIN
Good morning.

BARTLET
Good morning.

They begin walking to the podium where the President will give his speech.

BRUNO 
[to C.J.] He should remind them about the military pay raise.

C.J.
He won't.

BRUNO
He should.

C.J.
He won't.

BRUNO
Of course not. We're adding a hundred outpatient clinics to the VA hospitals. Is he going 
to mention...?

A cellphone rings and an assistant answers it.

C.J.
No.

BRUNO
Of course not. Military housing upgrades?

ASSISTANT
Bruno...

She hands Bruno the phone, but Bruno continues talking to C.J.

BRUNO
He should say, "We don't give these people anything. They earn it." [to phone] Yeah?

C.J. 
[to Bartlet] Gehrman-Driscoll announced before the bell it was filling for bankruptcy; 
an hour later, Jennings-Pratt and DWA.

BARTLET
They had exposure in the fund?

C.J.
Yeah.

BARTLET
I'm amazed it's only down 270.

C.J.
It's early.

BARTLET
That's what you want to say to me?

BRUNO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Driscoll announced it was filling, and Jennings and DWA were in the fund.

BRUNO
Pay raises, military housing, outpatient clinics.

BARTLET
It's against the law to campaign on a military base.

BRUNO
Yes, technically.

BARTLET
No, legally.

BRUNO
Sir...

BARTLET
These army guys are DRF-1. They're division ready. They can be deployed in two hours. 
These navy guys are going to deploy overseas for six months.

BRUNO
Yes, sir. I didn't realize...

BARTLET
C- bag and M-16, they're on a C-130 going where ever I tell them. And that's when their 
wives are told. I don't want to screw around with them.

BRUNO
I didn't realize they were Division Ready.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Bartlet begins to ascend the stairs to the platform.

BRUNO
You-you-you could always wink an-and... 

Bartlet stops, turns around and glares at Bruno.

BRUNO
I'm kidding. that was a joke. I kid because I love.

MAN
...the President of the United States.

The crowd cheers wildly as Bartlet walks to the podium.

BARTLET
Good morning. We haven't meet. I'm your Commander in Chief. 

The crowd erupts with laughter.

BARTLET
This is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and I want to tell you why.

CUT TO: EXT. A RURAL ROAD - DAY
Josh, Toby, and Cap are riding in the back of a red pickup truck, while Donna is sitting 
in the cab with Cathy.

CAP
It's just a regular diesel engine. There's no retrofitting. The glow plugs heat up the fuel, 
but from there the soy diesel just keeps exploding on itself like any engine.

JOSH
You did it yourself?

CAP
Oh, it's easy.

TOBY
He's out there right now. He started.

JOSH
We really need to get this guy to Unionville. He's going to wig.

TOBY
He's out there.

JOSH
Take you mind off it. Think about the lovely Cathy-- farmer's daughter with a master's degree. 
Wholesome but... maybe not too wholesome. I think she liked you too. [to Cap] How do you know Cathy?

CAP
She's my girlfriend.

JOSH 
[beat] That's great. She's really nice. Is that corn out there?

CAP
Nope.

JOSH
What is it?

CAP
Trees.

JOSH 
[hopelessly] Okay.

CUT TO: INT. NAVAL WARFARE CENTER CRANE - DAY

BARTLET
So what will I remember? What will I tell my grandchildren? I'll tell them that I stood on the 
Great Wall of China, and that I stood in the well of the U.S. House of Representitives. I'll tell 
them that I sat with kings and cardinals and made an appointment to the Supreme Court, and I'll 
tell them that one morning in September I got to spend a few minutes with the men and women of 
Air Wing One. God bless you and your families and may he continue to shed his magnificent grace 
upon the United States of America.

Crowd cheers and whistles for the President. A Choir begans to sing "Battle Hymn of the Republic" 
as Bartlet waves to the crowd and walks off the stage.

CHOIR
"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored..."

CUT TO: INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

NANCY
Charlie?

CHARLIE
Yeah?

NANCY
Leo McGarry for the President.

CHARLIE
Thanks. C.J.?

C.J.
I need to talk to you about something.

CHARLIE
In a minute, okay? I've got Leo for the President.

CHOIR
"Glory, glory hallelujah,
Glory, glory hallelujah..."

Bartlet is shaking hands with the men onstage when C.J. indicates that he has a phone call.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Margaret walks in to Leo's office.

MARGARET
You've got the President.

Leo answers phone.

LEO
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
How's it going?

LEO
You tell me.

BARTLET
It feels good.

LEO 
You know about the Dow?

BARTLET
Jennings-Pratt was in the fund?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
It'll rebound.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
No kidding, it feels good out here.

LEO]
Good.

BARTLET
What are you doing?

LEO
I'm going to meet with Fitzwallace for a minute.

BARTLET 
About what?

LEO
Nothing.

BARTLET
You don't meet with Fitzwallace about nothing.

LEO
Just something from the quicksheet briefing.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
Nothing.

BARTLET
Leo...

LEO
Qumar's reopened the investigation.

Bartlet has a look of concern on his face, and he doesn't respond to Leo.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah, all right. Well, we're coming home now.

LEO
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
Bartlet hangs up the phone, and with a grave look of concern on his face, he walks off 
while the choir is singing the last lines of the song.

CHOIR
"Glory, glory hallelujah,
His truth is marching on."

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
The red pick-up truck is driving down the road. Toby, Josh and Cap are on the back, 
while Donna and Cathy are in the cab.

DONNA
You sure we're not taking you away from something you need to be doing?

CATHY
No. Actually, this is on the way to my job.

DONNA
You have a second job?

CATHY
I'm a claims adjuster.

DONNA
That's unusual, isn't it?

CATHY
It has benefits.

DONNA
You get to meet people?

CATHY
No. I meant job benefits. Health insurance.

DONNA
It covers your father.

The pick-up truck begins to sputter.

CATHY
Uh-oh...

DONNA
What is it?

CATHY
You guys are going to kill me.

DONNA
Is it out of gas?

CATHY
There's a gas station about a thousand yards down the road.

JOSH
Why are we slowing down?

CAP
Uh-oh.

JOSH
Are we out of gas?

CAP
Diesel.

JOSH
Are we out of it?

The pick-up comes to a stop. Cathy gets out of the cab and walks to the back where Toby, 
Josh, and Cap are.

CATHY
We're out of gas.

CAP
Diesel.

TOBY
Nobody cares.

DONNA
Cathy says that ther's a gas station about a thousand yards down the road.

CAP
They don't have diesel.

TOBY
They don't have diesel.

JOSH
Did we run out of gas becasue I said she was wholesome but not too wholesome?

CAP
I can't make a car run out of gas.

JOSH
I don't know, you can make glow plugs explode things.

DONNA
Where's the closest diesel?

CAP
About ten miles.

DONNA
All right, can I suggest this: we've missed Unionville. We've got a little over an hour 
till the plane leaves and we can make it if we call a volunteer and have them pick us up 
at the gas station. You guys can have the tow truck meet you there.

CATHY
Oh, we're not calling a tow truck. It's just out of gas.

CAP
Diesel.

JOSH
What are you going to do?

CATHY
We'll hitch back to the farm and pick some up.

JOSH
Somebody's going to pick you up out here?A black pick-up truck approaches and stops.

SY
You guys run out of diesel?

CAP
Yeah.

SY
Need a lift back to the farm?

CAP
Thanks!

CATHY
Sy, these guys work for Bartlet.

JOSH
How you doing?

SY
Didn't vote for him the first time. Don't plan to the second time.

CATHY
Have a good trip back. Remember some of that stuff I said, okay?

JOSH
Thanks for all the help.

Cathy and Cap get into Sy's truck and leave. Donna is on her cellphone.

JOSH
Okay, call the State Office. Tell them to send a local volunteer. Tell them we don't 
have time... You're doing it right?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
This is fun. We're roughing it.

Josh looks at Toby who looks as if he wishes Josh would shut up.

JOSH
[less enthusiastically] This is fun.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is sitting at his desk thinking when Margaret enters.

MARGARET
The Chairman's here.

LEO
Thanks.

MAGARET
Do you have any idea why there were women with aprons and rolling pins at Mrs. Bartlet's 
Madison event this morning?

LEO
I'm sorry?

MARGARET
A friend of mine just called me from Madison to say she'd gone to see Mrs. Bartlet and there 
were about 20 women in back wearing aprons and holding rolling pins.

LEO
I don't know. Maybe they were making pies.

MARGARET
Yeah. Doesn't sound quite right, though, does it?

LEO
Send him in.

Margaret sends in Fitzwallace who closes the door after he enters.

FITZWALLACE
The tracks are covered.

LEO
Yeah.

FITZWALLACE
We did a legitmate SAR with the UK and Royal Qumari Guard. This a plane that went down in 
the Bermuda Triangle. Plain and simple.

LEO
And that really happens?

FITZWALLACE
What do you mean?

LEO
The Bermuda Triangle.

FITZWALLACE
Does it really happen?

LEO
I thought maybe it was like Toscanini landing in a cornfield.

FITZWALLACE
Planes, boats, about 200 of them-- including five navy avenger bombers and the rescue plane 
that went in after them.

LEO
Is there a chance they're going to find the plane?

FITZWALLACE
We dismantled the ELT, left the plane in 27 pieces, scattered among other wrecks, buried in 
underwater landslides and limestone cliffs. And if they find the plane, there's still no 
evidence of anything being anything. These were SEALs and these were Special Ops, and these 
guys know what they're doing.

LEO
Okay. Let's obviously stay in touch during the day.

FITZWALLACE
Yeah.

LEO
Just out of curiosity, what do you think would happen?

FITZWALLACE
I don't know what would happen to you and me but I'm pretty sure the President would be 
invited to see the inside of the Hague.

LEO
Yeah, well, they can invite all they want. He ain't going.

FITZWALLACE
Perhaps this would be a good time for you to reconsider your position on a international 
war crimes tribunal.

LEO
Perhaps this would be a good time for you to...

FITZWALLACE
Get out of your office.

LEO
Yeah.

FITZWALLACE
Talk tou you later.

LEO
Thank you.

	A 1:20 - PRESIDENT MET WITH MRS. WALKER
	A 1:40 - PRESIDENT MET WITH MRS. HARRISON

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - DAY

C.J.
Tonight-- I was wrong about this, tonight's black tie and pool pencil only. We've got a new 
addition to our running list of things Robert Ritchie's not. Speaking this morning at the 
Philadelphia Financial Council the Governor said, "I'm no scientist, but I know a thing or 
two about physics." So, for the week, you can add "scientist" to "doctor," "mind reader," 
and "Chinese."

MARK
C.J., do you have any idea why there were women at the First Lady's rally this morning who 
were dressed in... aprons and rolling pins ?

C.J.
They were dressed in rolling pins?

MARK
They were holding them, I guess. This is from the Milwaukee Sentinel.

C.J.
I don't know. Find out though, would you?

KATIE
Is the President coming back for questions?

C.J.
He's going to try, but he's got to spend time in his office interviewing secretary candidates. 
Steak sanwiches for lunch. I'll see you later.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

BARTLET
It's still mostly transportation and technology?

ED
And energy.

BARTLET
Have Josh and Toby weigh in at some point, okay?

LARRY
Yes, sir.

ED
Yes, sir.

LARRY
Thank you, Mr. President.

They exit and Charlie enters with a prospect for the secretarial position.

BARTLET
Yeah?

CHARLIE
Sir, this is Meredith Walker.

BARTLET
Come on in. Nice to meet you.

MEREDITH WALKER
Likewise, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I's crazy I know, but sometimes the schedule gets so tight that we have to schedule meetings 
on the plane, so we ask you to fly with us and hit you on the way back.

MEREDITH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Were you impressed by the plane?

MEREDITH
It's an airplane, sir. I'm not very easily impressed.

BARTLET
It's got an apartment and an operating room.

MEREDITH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Well, you've met with Donald McKittridge-- he directs the Office of Presidential Personnel.

MEREDITH
Yes.

BARTLET
You had a moment to meet with Charlie Young?

MEREDITH
Yes.

BARTLET
He's probably mentioned that this was a job where you to need to be able to hold a lot of 
names and dates and numbers in your head.

MEREDITH
Yes.

BARTLET
You were told what the pay scale was?

MEREDITH
Yes.

BARTLET
And some of the perks?

MEREDITH
Like what?

BARTLET
Well, for instance, we have our own 747, and it's flown by an Air Force general.

MEREDITH
Yes.

BARTLET
Okay, let's talk about your last job.

CUT TO: INT. GAS STATION - DAY

STORE MANAGER
Good morning.

JOSH
Good morning. We're stranded and waiting for a ride. Do you mind if we wait here?

STORE MANAGER
How did you get stranded?

JOSH
Well, we work for the President, actually, and he was campaining nearby this morning and...

STORE MANAGER
Oh, yeah.

JOSH
...we got left behind by the motorcade, then our ride ran out of diesel...

STORE MANAGER
Didn't vote for him the first time. Don't plan on voting for him the second time.

JOSH
Okay. Well, we'll just wait outside, if that's all right?

STORE MANAGER
I don't like loitering.

JOSH
Well, we'll just be a few minutes, I'm sure.

Josh exits the store and walks up to Donna who is thumbing through papers.

JOSH
Can we just call ahead and make sure the plane's going to be there when we fet there?

DONNA
It'll be there.

JOSH
Can you call ahead?

DONNA
I've been calling. I can't get anyone on their cell. They're in a bad calling area.

JOSH
Keep trying.

Donna gets on her phone. Josh walks towards Toby who's sitting on the front stoop of the 
gas station. Josh picks up a rock and throws it into a metal barrel across the parking lot.

JOSH
See that?

Toby picks up a rock and throws it into the barrel, then gives Josh a look of "I can do it too."

JOSH
First guy to miss.

TOBY
What's the bet?

JOSH
First guy to miss has to shave his beard.

TOBY
For the rest of the day... first guy to miss... anytime he says his name, has got to follow 
it with, "I work at the White House."

JOSH
All right. But I don't think you've meet our current host. Here we go.

Josh picks up a rock and throws it into the barrel. Toby then picks up a rock and throws it 
into the barrel.

TOBY
You didn't say if you thought it was a good event this morning.

JOSH
Well, I didn't see the President speak this morning.

TOBY
I know.

JOSH
I was out there talking with Cathy-- I was asked to.

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
I was.

TOBY
But you read the remarks.

JOSH
Yeah. [throws another rock into the barrel] What was your problem?

TOBY
You know what, Josh? I don't want this to be a high blood pressure day for me, either.

Toby tries to throw a rock into the barrel but misses.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. A RURAL ROAD - DAY
A red jeep is seen driving down the road. Toby and Josh are sitting in the back seat, 
while Donna is riding in the front seat with a boy named Tyler.

DONNA
It's great that you're volunteering, Tyler. You're not even old enough to vote, and here you 
are working for a campaign. That's great.

TYLER
They give us school credit.

DONNA
Well, good for your school.

TYLER
I mean, that's not the only reason I did it or anything.

DONNA
You like the President?

TYLER
Yeah, I think he's okay. I mean, most of my friends are for Ritchie. Not that they're political 
or anything, I guess, but their parents are for Ritchie so, you know, I guess...

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
"He pretends there are no energy alternatives 'cause he can't think of any." That wasn't in the 
staff copy yesterday. How did that make it into the speech today? "He pretends there are no 
energy alternatives 'cause he can't think of any." 

TOBY
They. They can't think of any.

JOSH
When we were touring flood damage in Missouri last Thursday, four times the President said, 
"Emergency managments complex."

TOBY
It is complex.

JOSH
What does that matter to people who just lost their house? Finding a place for their kids to 
sleep tonight is complex.

TOBY
Thanks, 'cause I was having a tough time prioritizing that one.

JOSH
Sustainable growth in Michigan, new economy in Ohio. Information technology in Pennsylvania. 
That's what you talk about in September. That's what we mapped out a year ago. You and Bruno 
and the President are calling audibles.

TOBY
That's because we're coming to the line and we're seeing a hairdo from Florida in pass coverage 
and so that's where we want to put the ball... What's your concern?

JOSH
I have any number of concerns, not the least of which we'll lose.

TOBY
I don't think so.

JOSH
When did we decide to make this about being the smartest kid in the class? What meeting did I miss?

TYLER
I have to pull over for a minute.

TOBY
Let me tell you something. What did he say?

TYLER
This will just take minute. 

Tyler stops the jeep in the middle of the road and jumps out.

TYLER
Kiki!

TOBY
What the hell...?

Tyler runs to catch up with three girls who are pushing their bicycles down the road.

TYLER
You don't return phone calls anymore?

KIKI
I return some.

TYLER
Thanks a lot.

KIKI
You know, we have to get back to school.

TYLER
What about the stuff I sent to your house?

KIKI
Yeah, could you stop sending stuff to my house? It's kind of creepy.

TYLER
Yeah, you know what? Sue me, I guess 'cause I love you. Place me under arrest, Kiki. Let's 
everybody do that. Lets everybody get a-a writ of injustice, lock me up and throw the book. 

JOSH
Tyler...

TYLER
Just a second, Mr. Lyman.

KIKI
You can't be creepy stalking guy, okay? You're not that guy, Tyler. You're better then that.

DONNA
Not that much better.

JOSH
Would you get in there? 

Donna moves to the teenagers' group.

FRIEND 1
You have to move on, Tyler. You have to live in the now. You're totally stressing her.

DONNA
Excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt in what obviously is a private moment between the two 
of you and your... two friends. We came in this morning...

FRIEND 2
We know who you are. We're not rednecks.

DONNA
Okay. Well, I'm Donna Moss and this is my boss.

JOSH
Josh Lyman.

TOBY
Toby Ziegler.

DONNA
Anyway, we're very crunched for time and we think that you...

TOBY
I work at the White House.

FRIEND 2
Wow, humongous whoop.

JOSH
Come on. He's Communications Diretor. It's a decent-sized whoop.

FRIEND 1
How many unborn babies did you guys kill today?

JOSH
Whoa, hey, danger, Will Robison. Tyler, no fooling around. We've got 15 minutes to get 
to a plane that is 3 miles from here. That plane-- I swear to God-- is taking off at 1:00.

TYLER
It's taking off a 1:00?

JOSH
Yes it is.

KIKI
Are you guys stupid or something? It's 1:45 right now.

JOSH
It's 12:45.

KIKI
No, not here it's not.

DONNA
Oh, my God, she's right.

TYLER
See, we crossed over from Unionville to Dearborn County which doesn't observe Dalight Saving Time.

KIKI
I think it's the other way around, genius.

TYLER
What did I ever do to you?

DONNA
It says on the schedule, "All times are local." This is why I couldn't get anyone on their cell.

JOSH
Wait. Wait. No. No. You're not... We changed time zones? We changed time... We changed time zones?!

TYLER
It's a-a common mistake.

JOSH
Not for the U.S. government!

TOBY
What kind of schmuck-ass system could this possibly...

JOSH
That's good! That's perfect!

TOBY
How did...? I don't understand.

JOSH
Perfect. Just the break I'm looking for.

TOBY
What do...? What do...? People, they just... They reset their watches when they commute?

JOSH
I can't take working here.

TOBY
They just change their watches every time they cross a time zone? What is this, a joke?!

JOSH
Serving my country.

DONNA
Okay, this is a whole new thing now. My guys are going to need to walk this off a bit before 
they can regroup. Kiki, you and your friends get back to school. Tyler, you and I are going 
to come up with a plan to get us to a commercial airport.

TYLER
Okay, how long are they going to be?

They turn around to se that Josh walking across the bridge and Toby has picked up a big stick 
and is whacking the guardrail.

DONNA
A couple more minutes.

TYLER
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - DAY
C.J. is sitting on a desk quietly consoling herself when Charlie walks in.

CHARLIE
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah.

CHARLIE
You wanted to talk to me?

C.J.
I'm sorry?

CHARLIE
You said back at the base you wanted to talk to me.

C.J.
Oh, yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you something. Simon was a Big Brother to a kid named 
Anthony Marcus.

CHARLIE
I met him a couple of times.

C.J.
I've been trying to spend a little time with him. He's not wild about me.

CHARLIE
He's associating you with Simon's death? I did that for awhile with some of the cops my mom worked with.

C.J.
Yeah? Well, he was arrested for stealing a car. He stole his homeroom teacher's car, drove it 
around for a few hours, then left it in front of a strip club. You could chalk it up to a stupid 
prank, except Anthony had a string of shoplifting incidents before Simon came along, so the ADA 
see it as an escalating problem which is...

CHARLIE
Graduating from a misdemeanor to a felony?

C.J.
Right, and she's pushing juvenile detention. I've spoken to her and if a White House staffer 
will play a role in his life, she's willing to reconsider.

CHARLIE
God, C.J...

C.J.
I know.

CHARLIE
I just got Deanna off to school.

C.J.
I know.

CHARLIE
And with the campaign now, the days are even longer. I didn't even think that was possible.

C.J.
I know, it was a longshot.

CHARLIE
I just don't think I'm the right guy for the job.

STAFFER
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

CHARLIE
I'm sorry.

STAFFER
I've got an answer on the rolling pins.

C.J.
Okay. [to Charlie] I shouldn't have asked you.

CHARLIE
I'm glad you did. Listen, you're not just going to ask the people who look like me, right? 
'Cause a Big Brother's a Big Brother. It doesn't...

C.J.
Sam's next.

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
Sam is asleep in his bed. The telephone rings and the answer machine picks up.

ANSWER MACHINE
Hi, it's Sam. I'm sleeping for a few hours right now, so you can leave a message or if you 
really need me, you can shout into the machine, and I'll wake up. [beep]

JOSH [on phone]
[yelling] Saaaaam!!!

Sam nearly falls out of his bed, knocking over his lamp while trying to reach for the phone.

SAM
Sorry. It's all right. Hang on. No problem. Hi. Sorry.

CUT TO: EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

JOSH
No, I'm sorry buddy. I know you're supposed to be sleeping today.

SAM
No, it's no problem. What's going on?

JOSH
I'm with Toby and Donna and we are stranded somewhere in Indiana.

SAM
You got left behind by the motorcade?

JOSH
Yeah. and then we ran out of gas, and then there was a time zone foul-up, and also, 
we were waylaid by some mean schoolgirls. Alpha girls, you know what I'm saying?

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
They were.

SAM
So, what are you doing now?

JOSH
We're getting a lift to the Connersville Metro which is going to take us to Indianapolis 
where we're going to get a flight to either Dulles or BWI or LaGuardia.

SAM
Listen, if you want to give me your call sheets and I can farm a out a few memos for you.

JOSH
I actually need you to do more than that, Sam. I need you to staff the President. He's got 
one of those days.

SAM
I don't know what it is you do in there.

JOSH
Yeah, you do. Anything ceremonial, security related, or personal, you've leave the room. 
As it gets later in the day he's going to start to talk to you. You're going to tell him 
how the meeting he just had with his Concil of Economic advisors relates to the meeting 
he had with the Agriculture Secretary, relates to his intelligence breifing, relates to 
the environment, relates to jobs, relates to education, relates to the campaign. You're 
his wide-angle lens. 

SAM
There are going to be any number of areas on which I can't give him expert advise.

JOSH
Welcome to the club, partner. We got jackets.

SAM
All right. I'm not going to let you down.

JOSH
You never do.

SAM
Get dressed... now.

JOSH
Let's get to the train station.

TYLER
You ever love so much it hurts? Like, physically hurts?

TOBY
Get in the car.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

BARTLET
There's a tremendous amount of informatin you need to keep track of: dates, names, number, 
things I'm not good with.

MRS. HARRISON
That's unusual, isn't it?

BARTLET
What's that?

MRS. HARRISON
A man of your intellect not being good with names and numbers. Especially an economist of 
your stature.

BARTLET
It's not intellect, it's memory. It's a different gift. A wonderful one. I've never had it.

MRS. HARRISON
There are excersises you can do.

BARTLET
Well... okay, I'll try and find that time, but let's get back to you. What would you say was 
the most challenging part of working for the Ambassador of France?

MRS. HARRISON
The pliable relationship the French have with time.

BARTLET
Mm.

MRS. HARRISON
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
I make fun of the French as much as anybody and I don't even know what that meant.

MRS. HARRISON
I meant...

BARTLET
Nah, that's okay. I think you're terrific and I appreciate your coming in and talking to us.

MRS. HARRISON
Thank you, sir. I look forward to talking to your office.

BARTLET
Thanks again.

CHARLIE
I'll be right with you. Can you see Bruno?

BARTLET
Yeah. Hey.

BRUNO
You want some good news, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Please, the market's down 425 points.

BRUNO
Well, I think it's going to rally but even if it doesn't, this one isn't attributable to anything...

BARTLET
I know.

BRUNO
I'm saying...

BARTLET
425 points represents billions of dollars which aren't there anymore heading into the fourth 
quarter which is Christmas.

BRUNO
Well, I thinks it's going to rally.

BARTLET
What's your good news?

BRUNO
We've held or made slight gains in almost all the polls. ABC/Washington Post, Bartlet 50, Ritchie 44. 
I'm all right referring to you colloquially? CBS/ New York Times, Bartlet 50, Ritchie 43. NBC/ Wall 
Street Journal, Bartlet 49, Ritchie 43.

BARTLET
You said almost all.

BRUNO
CNN/USA Today/ Gallup, Bartlet 46, Ritchie 45.

BARTLET
Why does Gallup have it a one-point race?

BRUNO
It's 'cause...

BARLTET
'Cause they're polling likely voters and not registered voters. That's why they're getting the 
same numbers we do.

BRUNO
Wait till the debates. Elections in six weeks, Mr. President. The world was created in a lot less time.

BARTLET
Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you'll tell us all how you did it.

BRUNO
Thank you, sir.

C.J.
Bruno.

BRUNO
Yeah.

C.J.
Yesterday, the First Lady appeared on KCAL, which is a local LA station. She was asked about 
the suspension of her medical license and she said something like, "I'm just a wife and mother." 

BRUNO
And that has been interpreted in some circles as merely a wife and mother?

C.J.
This is Flint Aldridge, a Southern Baptist radio host. "This is another sign that Abbey Bartlet 
is a liberal elitist feminist."

BRUNO
Elitist, feminist-- you can't do that to the English language.

C.J.
And this is from Janet Ritchie.

BRUNO
Janet Ritchie went on the record?

C.J.
"Being a wife and a mother are the most rewarding roles I've ever played. I think Abbey Bartlet 
and I have two different ambitions."

BRUNO
Ooh, she won $50. Said the secret word right there-- ambition. Phyllis Schlafly and Ann Coulter 
are going to have a sqaure dance.

C.J.
Anyway, it's waiting for us down on the ground.

BRUNO
Then let's stay up here and have drinks.

CAPTAIN
Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman.

BRUNO
Janet Ritchie really went on the record?

C.J.
Yeah.

BRUNO
I love it when the women get involved.

CAPTAIN
I've begun our decent into Andrew's Air Force Base and I'm going to ask those who are so 
inclined to take their seats and fasten their seatbelts.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

	A 3:30 - PRESIDENT MET WITH SECRETARY BRYCE, 
		 JOINED BY NESSRS. WENDEL, LEE, ALDEE AND STANISLOUS AND MS. WISSINGER
	A 3:35 - PRESIDENT MET WITH MR. LIEN. JOINED BY MR. McGARRY
	A 3:45 - PHOTO-OP WITH MR. KIETH. [RE-SCHEDULED]

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY

GINGER
The first two are easy.

SAM
It's Bryce.

GINGER
He just wants to talk about why the department didn't participate more in...

SAM
Okay.

GINGER
Then it's Peter Lien and a photo-op.

SAM
What's the photo-op?

GINGER
It's a man who's shaken the hand of every President since Herbert Hoover.

SAM
All right. Do we have some sort of condensed Readers Digest index of... well, all human knowledge?

GINGER
We usually just use Margaret.

SAM
Okay, well, we'll have to talk about that but we'll do it another time. Soon, though. Why don't 
you get me my notes from this mornings speech in Bloomfield.

GINGER
I've got them out.

SAM
Hey, were there women with aprons and rolling pins at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin this morning?

BRUNO
Yeah.

SAM
Why?

BRUNO
Abbey Bartlet's a lesbian.

Bruno reaches the Roosevelt Room.

C.J.
What the hell does that mean, "I love it when the women get involved?"

BRUNO
She's talking to me, right?

C.J.
Abbey...

BRUNO
I'm not talking about Abbey and Janet Ritchie. I'm talking about the women, the voters continuing 
their unbroken streak. The biggest nonsense issue in the campaign will belong to the women. Does 
Abbey Bartlet love her children? Next week, Grandpa: friend or foe?

C.J.
This is not a woman's issue. This is dumb woman's issue.

BRUNO
I think anybody who's got a five-point majority and still doesn't control the agenda, might be 
spending a little to much time reading about how to get a man to get over his fear of commitment.

C.J.
Remind me to mention that to the population of South Africa.

BRUNO
You know what? In the scheme of things? It took them about five minutes.

C.J.
Can we start?

BRUNO
Yeah.

C.J.
Several of the men I've dated haven't yet gotten over their fear of frogs.

BRUNO
Okay.

LARRY
Has anybody seen tape on this?

C.J.
I still haven't.

CAROL
We're getting it.

BRUNO
She was asked about her license. She said, "Right now, I'm just a wife and mother."

LARRY
Option one is we make a joke out of it.

BRUNO
We make a joke out of it? What would we have to do to it to make...?

C.J.
Yeah, the rolling pins took care of that.

BRUNO
It is pret-a-porter.

C.J.
Remind me to get Josh in on this. Option two?

CUT TO: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
We pan from a man putting a horse in the back of a trailer to the highway, where we see
Toby, Donna, Josh and Tyler cruising in the red jeep. They pull off of the road into the 
parking lot of a small diner.

JOSH
It's Monday.

DONNA
Yeah. Why?

JOSH
Nothing. It was just something I said. All right, ten minutes. We get the stuff to go.

They walk inside the DINER.

TOBY
Tyler?

TYLER
Yes, sir?

TOBY
What's a Hoosier?

TYLER
A Hoosier's someone from Indiana.

TOBY
Afternoon.

FIONA
Yes.

TOBY
We'd like some food to go.

FIONA
What would you like?

TOBY
What's good?

FIONA
Everything.

TOBY
What's your specialty?

FIONA
Taking someone's order and giving it to them.

TOBY
Okay.

FIONA
I saw you drive up. You people going to cause trouble.

TOBY
I swear not on purpose.

FIONA
Everytime he comes around here, there's trouble. I don't want leaflets around my place. 
You handing out leaflets?

TOBY
No, uh, we just want food.

FIONA
Yeah, well, what to do need?

TOBY
You wouldn't say there was some sort of local delicacy...

FIONA
I'm getting my husband.

Fiona walks off to the back of the diner.

TOBY
Right, uh... [to man sitting at counter] Excuse me. Would you mind terribly if I changed 
the channel to CNN for just a minute? I've, uh, been a little out of touch today. I would 
like to check in with what's been going on.

MAN
Earl and Fiona don't get cable TV. Three channels are enough. The picture's fuzzy today. 
I think there's going to be weather.

Fiona and her husband Earl come from the back.

EARL
What the hell, boy?

TOBY
I was just asking what's good.

EARL
Yeah?

TOBY
We'll take four cheeseburgers.

EARL
The dry rub is good.

TOBY
Dry rub?

EARL
Yeah. You dry rub the beef with spices for a day or two. Sauce is a myth.

TOBY
Okay. See, Fiona, this is exactly what I was talking about.

FIONA
Shut up!

Fiona trumps off to the back.

EARL
She's been in a bad mood for... well, about 45 years, I guess.

CUT TO: INT. DINER TABLE - CONTINUOUS
Donna, Josh, and Tyler are sitting down at a table in the diner.

DONNA
Out in the parking lot when you said it's Monday, I flashed on the song. A few days ago, 
someone told me that a girl shot up her school one morning and we they asked her why, 
she said, "I don't like Mondays," and that's where the song comes from.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
You knew that?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
That's where the song comes from?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
I'm sorry about the time zones.

Toby approaches table and sits down.

JOSH
Why is it we cite Ritchie's advisors by name? The Milton Friedman economic plan? The Leonard 
Tynan education plan?

TOBY
I give credit where credit's due.

JOSH
It's our way of calling him a puppet, right?

TOBY
Josh, he cites them more then we do, which is his way of saying, "I want to be President 
the same way you want a cold beer."

JOSH
No. It's his way of saying, "I think it's great that Bartlet's a Nobel Prize winner. 
When I'm elected, I'm going to hire me some of those."

TOBY
No, no. Should be what he's saying. What he's saying is, "Eastern education isn't for real men, 
but don't worry. I'll have Jews for the money stuff." You mind calling C.J. for me?

JOSH
That line from the convention speech-- "challenges too great for a Potemkin presidentcy?"

TOBY
It is true.

JOSH
Most people weren't the smartest kid in the class. Most people didn't like the smartest kid 
in the class.

TOBY
Yeah?

JOSH
I don't care how subliminal it is. This can't be a national therapy session.

DONNA
C.J.

Donna hands Toby the cellphone.

TOBY
Thank you. Hello.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

C.J. 
[into phone] Hey, before I forget. If you see Josh, can you ask him to stop by my office?

CUT TO: INT. DINER - DAY
Toby sets the phone down on the table.

C.J.
Toby?

JOSH
What?

TOBY
She'd like you to stop by her office.

C.J.
Toby, are you there?

Josh picks up the phone.

JOSH
C.J., it's me. Did you happen to notice that we weren't on the plane?

C.J.
You weren't on the plane?

JOSH
We missed the plane.

C.J.
What happened between Unionville and the plane?

JOSH
We missed Unionville. We missed the motorcade.

C.J.
Bummer.

JOSH
Yeah.

FIONA
Dry rub's up!

C.J.
I love dry rub. They take the meat and...

Josh closes the phone in the middle of C.J.'s sentence.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Sam is waiting in the Oval Office when Bartlet enters from the colonnade.

SAM
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Seth Weinberger's assistant has come forward with the information that he was having an 
affair with a colleague and a newspaper has printed it.

SAM
What's the assistant's thing?

BARTLET
You tell me. He'd already stepped down over OSHA. It's been two months. This is an assistant 
getting her name in the paper and it's unbelievably hurtful to his wife. I don't understand it. 
I don't understand the paper printed it either, but that's another day. This is terrible.

SAM
Yes, sir.

CHARLIE
Secretary Bryce.

BARTLET
Good.

SAM
Is there a place you'd like me to stand or sit?

BARTLET
Hmm?

SECRETARY BRYCE
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Mitch, come on in. [to Sam] Just rock and roll, Sam.

BARTLET
Hey.

LARRY
[to Sam] Josh likes to stand over there.

BRYCE
I wanted to mention first of all, Mr. President, that I think you could seed Commerce's input on, 
uh... I'm not going to say what you could seek.

SAM
Actually, Mr. Secretary, if you're talking about he stump speech, and energy in particular, 
that's not the President's fault. I was just looking at my notes from...

BARTLET
We have your input. You're talking about the exemption.

BRYCE
It is sheer lunacy to suggest America takes unilateral steps while exempting 80% of the world's 
nations from the same obligations.

BARTLET
Developing nations, and I think what's lunacy is a nation of SUV's telling a nation of 
bicycles, that they have to change the way the live before we'll agree to do something 
about greenhouse emission.

BRYCE
Among our economic competitors there's the principle of fairness.

BARTLET
Well, in international law there's a principle called differentiated responsibilties. 
We're the ones making the greenhouse gas!

There is a scattered applause. Ed looks at his watch.

ED
47 seconds.

LARRY
Who had 47 seconds?

BRYCE
You're losing the support of the business community.

BARTLET
Mr. Secretary, it's not your job to tell me whose support I'm losing. We have people who 
do that. It's your job to tell me whose support you just got for me.

BRYCE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

BRYCE
Thank you, Mr. President.

Secretary Bryce and his staff depart from the Oval Office, while Bartlet walks to his desk.

BARTLET 
[to Larry] Ed.

LARRY
Well, I'm Larry, sir.

BARTLET
Whatever. Seth Weinberger's old assistant...

LARRY
I saw that.

BARTLET
I don't think a lot of blind loyalty, but I think a lot less of blind betrayal.

LARRY
That's why I haven't gotten married yet, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah, that's probably why.

CHARLIE
Congressman Lien.

BARTLET
Could somebody get Leo for me, please? Peter, you hear that? He called you "congressman."

CONGRESSMAN PETER LIEN
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You think when your folks got you out in '74, they imagined they were taking you to a place 
that'd be willing to make you a Congressman?

LIEN
As a matter of fact, sir, I think that's exactly what they imagined.

BARTLET
Me too. How's fishing?

LIEN
It's been a good season.

BARTLET
You catch any marlin?

LIEN
Marlin's a game fish, sir. Not a lot of people eat them.

BARTLET
Takes a fisherman to catch one, though, right?

LIEN
Oh, yeah.

BARTLET
Okay, I'm just saying.

LEO
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Leo, meet Congressman Peter Lien, Texas 22nd. Peter, this is Leo McGarry, U.S. Air Force, 
144th Fighter Wing.

LEO
Pleased to meet you, Congressman.

BARTLET
Peter's family fishes in Galveston Bay, but they don't catch marlin. It's a sore spot, 
and he doesn't like to talk about it. Peter's 34 years old.

LEO
I'm sorry it's been two months and we haven't been able to get you up here until now.

LIEN
No, please. It's a bust time. If there's any help I can give you in Texas...

BARTLET
Ordinarily I would tell you that Jim Coor was a good public servant, and you've got big shoes 
to fill, and he was and you do, but obviously you have a bigger symbolic responsibilty then that.

LIEN
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
But you biggest responsibiltity isn't symbolic, right?

LIEN
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What is it?

LIEN
It's my district, my country, and the Congress of the United States.

BARTLET
Welcome, my freind, to the show that never ends.

LIEN
Thank you, Mr. President.

They turn around to take picture of Congressman Lien shaking Bartlet's hands. Sam, Larry, Leo, 
and Bartlet watch the Congressman exit.

BARTLET
Isn't that a hell of a thing? What's next?

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
