TEASER

FADE IN: INT. A FLIGHT OF STAIRS - NIGHT
A man in a suit we'll know later as KOVALESKI is accompanied by a uniformed guard as they go down 
the stairs. In Kovaleski's hand is a blue file. We follow them downstairs, into the hallway, and 
into an office labeled OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE CLERK. Kovaleski opens the door to the dark office 
as the guard follows behind him. The only man in the room, DONALD DOLAN greets them.

DONALD DOLAN
Good morning.

KOVALESKI
Are you Dolan?

DOLAN
Yes, and you're Mr. Kobaleski?

KOVALESKI
Kovaleski. With a "v."

DOLAN
We spoke on the phone. As I said I'm the only one here right now.

KOVALESKI
That's okay.

DOLAN
There's usually seven of us, but...

KOVALESKI
Yeah.

DOLAN
And I'm new. It's the end of my second week.

KOVALESKI
Do you know what to do?

DOLAN
I call the deputy chief of staff.

KOVALESKI
And you tell him the Clerk of the House has delivered a bill. Then you bring it to the President 
for his signature or veto.

DOLAN
Yeah.

KOVALESKI
Okay. Here it is.

He hands Dolan the blue file, which turns out to be the death tax bill, and heads out.

DOLAN
Thank you.

Dolan picks up the phone and dials just as Kovaleski exits with the guard in uniform.

DOLAN
Yes. This is Mr. Dolan in the Executive Clerk's Office. I'd like Mr. Lyman, please.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Donna is busy tying Josh's bow tie. Josh is dressed up for a formal occasion.

DONNA
Why don't you just wear a pre-tied tie?

JOSH
'Cause it's not the same.

DONNA
It looks the same.

JOSH
At the end of the night, you want to be able to pull it open, like Tony Bennett.

DONNA
You think the tie is the only thing standing between you and Tony Bennett?

JOSH
He's also shorter than I am.

DONNA
Do you know when you're bringing Buckland back here?

JOSH
[sighs] I was gonna do it before the entree.

DONNA
You should do it after the entree.

JOSH
Why?

DONNA
I don't know. It's more polite.

JOSH
Is there etiquette for this?

DONNA
No.

JOSH
Then why are you bothering me?

Josh's phone rings.

DONNA
I need to talk to you about something.

JOSH
My phone's ringing.

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
You want to answer it?

Donna finally finishes with the bow tie.

DONNA
Can we talk sometime tonight? Maybe after the cheese course?

JOSH
Donna?

Donna turns and picks up the phone.

DONNA
Josh Lyman. Yes. [hangs up and turns to Josh] It's here.

JOSH
Call around.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT
C.J., dressed in a beautiful red evening gown, is putting her shoes on. Toby, on the other hand, 
is waiting by the door.

C.J.
Quiz me.

TOBY
I don't think I will.

C.J.
Quiz me.

TOBY
You're a lively conversationalist. You won't have any problem getting...

C.J.
Quiz me.

TOBY
Who are you sitting next to?

C.J.
Dr. Kary B. Mullis, recipient of the 1993 Nobel Prize for chemistry. Born 1944, North Carolina. 
He earned his Bachelor's Degree from Georgia Tech and his PhD. in biochemistry from my alma mater, 
U.C. Berkeley.

TOBY
If all he wants to talk about is where he's from, where he went to school, and what his name is, 
you'll be fine.

Carol shows up at the door.

CAROL
C.J.?

TOBY
It's here?

CAROL
Yeah.

TOBY
Uh...

C.J.
(to Toby) I'll meet you there.

Toby exits into the hallway, where he joins Sam. They're headed for the Oval Office.

SAM
Toby?

TOBY
Uh, it's here.

SAM
Yeah, I know. Listen. The Social Office called.

TOBY
And?

SAM
They said the Republicans who RSVP'd for the dinner aren't gonna show up.

TOBY
We knew that might happen.

SAM
Well, it happened. You think we should...

TOBY
What? Put it off?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
I know.

SAM
I'm saying...

TOBY
The President said he was gonna veto the bill. C.J. announced he was gonna veto the bill. 
He's gonna veto the bill.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE COLONNADE - NIGHT
Bartlet, formally dressed as well, is walking with Leo.

BARTLET
There was a reason they had to cancel.

LEO
There's an emergency meeting of the Republican Leadership.

BARTLET
What do you think they're gonna be talking about?

LEO
I think they're planning a surprise party.

BARTLET
They could have left after the entree.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
They're gonna miss hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.

LEO
Yeah.

They reach THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
That's a pretty big price to pay just to override my veto.

LEO
Maybe they think they've got the vote.

BARTLET
What are you saying?

LEO
Maybe something shifted in the last couple of hours.

BARTLET
Leo...

LEO
They just sent the bill out five minutes ago. They know you're gonna veto. Why schedule an override 
vote right now?

BARTLET
So I'd think twice about vetoing.

LEO
Well, that's what I thought too.

BARTLET
And now?

Leo shrugs a little as Josh enters.

JOSH
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Where is this thing?

JOSH
It's on its way.

BARTLET
You know what we're starting with tonight?

JOSH
No, sir.

BARTLET
Hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.

JOSH
Was anything you just said food?

Toby and Sam enter.

TOBY
Good evening, Mr. President.

SAM
Good evening, sir.

BARTLET
It's on its way.

SAM
Sir, the Social Office...

LEO
We know.

SAM
Seven Republicans who RSVP'd for the dinner...

LEO
We know.

SAM
You know that there's an emergency meeting of the Republican Leadership?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I say they could've waited until after the entree.

JOSH
Maybe they didn't know about the chevre brioche.

SAM
Does anyone want to consider waiting?

TOBY
No.

SAM
The Constitution gives them ten days.

TOBY
I'm familiar with it.

SAM
So why don't we...?

TOBY
'Cause if it's a show of strength and resolve, you don't wait to think about it.

SAM
And if they override the veto, it's neither strong nor resolute.

TOBY
They don't have the votes to override.

SAM
Says you.

TOBY
Says me, Josh, the office of the Political Liaison, Legislative Liaison, and the Minority Whip.

BARTLET
Sometimes it's like I don't even need to be here.

C.J. arrives.

C.J.
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
C.J., you look very nice.

C.J.
Thank you, sir. Is it here?

LEO
It's on its way.The room falls silent for a minute.

C.J.
I've been seated next to a chemist tonight.

BARTLET
Mullis?

C.J.
Twenty-three Nobel Prize winners in the East Room, I couldn't get literature, or I don't know, 
peace or something?

LEO
[to Toby] What's her problem?

TOBY
She thinks she won't be able to make conversation with the guy, but she's wrong 'cause she knows 
what year he was born and his name.

C.J.
You got to be a cryptographer. They speak in combinations of letters that don't spell anything, 
but end up meaning table salt.

Charlie appears at the door.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Is it here?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

Charlie exits, and Dolan enters. He has the bill in his hands. His speech shows nervousness.

BARTLET
Hey.

DOLAN
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
What's your name?

DOLAN
I'm Donald Dolan from the Office of the Executive Clerk, sir.

SAM
Leo, I don't think it's a bluff. I don't think the Congressional Leadership holds their members 
back on a weekend for a bluff.

LEO
I don't think they're bluffing, Sam.

TOBY
You think they're holding an override vote tonight?

LEO
I'm sure of it.

TOBY
Why would they hold a vote if they didn't think they could override?

BARTLET
They wouldn't. What do you got in the box, Mr. Dolan?

Dolan approaches the desk and offers the bill to the President.

DOLAN
Mr. President, I have House Resolution 10, the Death Tax Elimination Act. It bears the signatures of 
both the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, and is presented to you by the Congress 
of the United States for your signature or veto.

TOBY
Excuse me.

Dolan steps back to get out of Toby's way.

TOBY
Leo, you think we lost some votes we don't know about?

LEO
I think we're about to find out.

JOSH
Sir, if the House successfully overrides the veto, we're gonna look weak.

BARTLET
If the House successfully overrides the veto, we are weak.

Bartlet signs and stamps the bill.

BARTLET
NaCl, C.J.

C.J.
I'm sorry, sir?

BARTLET
Table salt. [gives the bill back to Dolan] Send it back.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

C.J.
The clerk of the House presented the executive clerk with HR10, a bill repealing the estate tax, 
which our opponents sometimes call the Death Tax, or the We're Coming to Get Your Children tax. 
[laughter] We call it a tax on fewer than two percent of American estates valued at over a million 
dollars, the revenue from which helps fund frivolous Democratic spending programs, such as teaching 
people to read and curing disease. As promised, the President vetoed the bill, which was his first 
veto since taking the office 33 months ago. [clamor] Katie?

KATIE
Will there be a vote to override tonight?

C.J.
We don't know. Phil?

PHIL
You know why the Republican leadership's meeting in an emergency session tonight?

C.J.
Nope.

MIKE
They've held the members back. Would they have done that if they didn't think they could hold a vote 
tonight and override?

C.J.
You'd have to ask them.

SHERRI WEXLER
C.J.!

C.J.
Yeah.

SHERRI
Can you tell us what you're wearing?

C.J.
It's a dress.

SHERRI
C.J...

C.J.
Diane Cook. Anything else? Okay, I'll be in for periodic briefings and we'll try not to keep you 
too late. [walks out, to Carol] What's Sherri Wexler doing here?

CAROL
It's Friday night.

C.J. and Carol walk out the HALLWAY.

C.J.
She's an entertainment reporter.

CAROL
Local news. She was here to cover the Nobel dinner.

C.J.
Yeah, but now she's going to cover a veto override in the House and I'm saying this is a girl who 
barely covers an Easter Egg hunt.

CAROL
What, are you afraid she's going to misspell Diane Cook?

C.J.
Ah, I've got to get back to dinner. Do you happen to have a copy of the Periodic Table of Elements?

CAROL
No.

C.J.
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam is inside on the phone.

SAM 
[into phone] Yeah. [hangs up as Toby passes with a coffee cup] Toby!

TOBY
What did...?

SAM
That was the Minority Leader's office. They've scheduled a vote.

TOBY
When?

SAM
Ninety minutes. An hour to debate, then 20 minutes to vote.

TOBY
What do they think?

SAM
They think they must be down. How did we lose votes since yesterday?

TOBY
A low-in-the-polls president tells the chicken-ass Democrats to vote against a tax cut in an election 
cycle. What could possibly have gone wrong? Ginger!

GINGER
Yeah!

TOBY
We're going to need ten phone lines in the Roosevelt room and some bodies from Legislative affairs!

Ginger nods at the door and walks away.

SAM
We need a whip count.

TOBY
The old whip count doesn't do us any good. We need a new one.

SAM
That's going to take a while.

TOBY
They're all sitting there. Tell them to raise their hands.

SAM
Bonnie!

BONNIE
Yeah.

SAM
Any Democratic members who've headed for National, get them back. Page Delta, United American. 
Nobody gets on a plane.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Sam, Toby, Ed and Larry come in.

LARRY
They scheduled a vote?

SAM
Straight up or down.

LARRY
When?

SAM
They start the debate in 90 minutes and vote an hour after that.

LARRY
We need a new whip count.

TOBY
[shouts] Ginger, the phones, the bodies, and keep an open line to the Whip's office!

GINGER [VO]
It's coming!

TOBY
And get Leo out of the dinner!

SAM
Excuse me. [steps out] Charlie?

Out in the HALLWAY, Sam walks with Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

SAM
How's the dinner going?

CHARLIE
Fine.

SAM
You and I should talk, you know.

CHARLIE
Yeah?

SAM
The committee's going to offer you a chance to give a proffer.

CHARLIE
Look...

SAM
I know they are.

CHARLIE
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

SAM
You know what it is, right?

CHARLIE
I get immunity.

SAM
Yeah.

CHARLIE
And I'm not allowed to talk about it. 

Sam nods, and Charlie walks off. Donna catches up with Sam.

DONNA
So what's going on?

SAM
We're waiting for a new whip count. Listen... how ready is he on the environment?

DONNA
He's been studying.

SAM
I don't think I'll be able to get in there with him.

DONNA
In the Buckland meeting?

SAM
Yeah, I've got this in here. [points to the Roosevelt room]

DONNA
He'll be all right.

SAM
When is he doing it?

DONNA
Uh, sometime after the appetizer, before the entrée.

SAM
He needs to look at the latest EPA stats on child asthma, all right? Tell him!

DONNA
[as she walks into the Mural Room] He's got them!

SAM
[returning to Roosevelt room] What's going on?

LARRY
There's three we can't account for. We think Kimball flipped.

SAM
If it was Kimball, he'd have taken half of his committee with him.

GINGER
[walks in] Toby, the phone in front of you.

LARRY
Newhouse?

SAM
Newhouse I don't believe. Illinois 17 is safe. He doesn't want anything

Leo enters.

LEO
What's happening?

SAM
There's a vote scheduled. We don't' have the count. I don't think it's Newhouse, I don't think 
it's Kimball.

TOBY
[phone in hand] It's Kimball.

SAM
I'm telling you, if it was Kimball, we'd have six...

TOBY
It's Kimball on the phone right now.

LEO
[takes the phone] Congressman, this is Leo McGarry. Please come to the White House right away. 
[hangs up]

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT 
Josh bursts in.

JOSH
Donna?

DONNA
[at her desk] I'm right here, where do you think that...

JOSH
My tie's falling apart.

DONNA
Give me that. [stands up and starts redoing his tie]

JOSH
It's not going to be...

DONNA
It's not going to be Tom Jones tonight.

JOSH
Tony Bennett.

DONNA
Speaker's calling a vote?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Sam's not going to be able to be in the Buckland meeting with you.

JOSH
I'll be all right.

DONNA
He wanted to make sure you looked at the new EPA stats on child asthma.

JOSH
I got them.

DONNA
Can I talk to you about something personal?

JOSH
I gotta get back to dinner. Can it wait a little bit?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
[pointing at the tie] How's it look?

DONNA
Good.

Josh leaves. Donna watches him go.

CUT TO: INT. A ROOM IN THE BULLPEN - NIGHT 
Sam, Toby, and Leo are inside.

SAM
Maybe he wants the compromise back on the table.

TOBY
He doesn't want to compromise.

SAM
He was ready to settle for a 10 million-dollar exemption instead of a 5 million.

TOBY
Compromising with a 10 million-dollar exemption - here's a conversation my father never had.

MARGARET
[comes in] Leo.

LEO [to Sam and Toby]
You're going to have to give away something, but don't give away the store. 

Leo walks out to the HALLWAY with Margaret.

LEO
Yeah?

MARGARET
Nancy McNally is in your office.

LEO
What's going on?

MARGARET
Something's happened.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo comes in as Nancy McNally stands in front of his desk.

LEO
What's going on?

NANCY
A bomb went off outside a café on Ben Yehuda in Jerusalem. There was a suicide bomber, he detonated 
explosives strapped to his body.

LEO
How bad is it?

NANCY
Ten people were killed right away. It looks about a hundred and twenty-five injured, mostly young 
adults. Leo, two of the dead were American students. We think they may have been targeted.

LEO
[beat] All right. 

Nancy heads out. He follows her.

LEO
Margaret, I'll be in the Situation Room.

Both Leo and Nancy walk down the hallway.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT 

NANCY
[to phone] Yeah. Leo, the INP thinks they have traces of C-4. 

LEO
C-4? 

NANCY
Yeah. 

LEO
Did this guy have a car strapped to his chest? 

GENERAL
Ten-hut. 

BARTLET
[entering] Have the parents been notified? 

NANCY
The consul general called the parents. 

BARTLET
Has anyone claimed responsibility? 

LEO
Not yet. 

NANCY
In the next hour, everyone will claim responsibility. 

BARTLET
Nancy, hasn't State issued travel warnings since Bekaa? 

NANCY
They were there for a soccer match. 

BARTLET
The Americans were targeted? 

ADVISOR
Initial eyewitness accounts indicate the bomber turned left to go into the nightclub then stopped 
when he saw two people wearing U.S. Delegation sweatshirts with insignias and flags. 

OTHER ADVISOR
They were brothers-- Ariel and Noah Levy.

ADVISOR
He walked up to them and detonated. 

BARTLET
We know this? 

NANCY
These are the facts as relayed by the embassy RSO at the scene. 

LEO
And, Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

LEO
They think they've found traces of C-4. 

BARTLET
You think there's an Afghan connection? 

LEO
Or even Iran. 

NANCY
We'll know more when the FBI attache gives a forensic analysis. 

BARTLET
How long? 

NANCY
45 minutes, an hour. 

BARTLET
I'm going to want some temperature-cooling options. 

ADVISORS
Thank you, sir. Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT 
C.J. stands next to Margaret's desk.

C.J.
"Na" is sodium. Sodium comes from the english word "soda" so wouldn't it make sense for the periodic 
symbol to be somehow related to that? No, because "na" comes from the latin word "natrium." 

MARGARET
What does "natrium" mean? 

C.J.
It means "sodium." 

LEO
[passes by] Come on in. 

C.J. follows Leo inside.

C.J.
I'm pretty well briefed. 

LEO
Is it on the news yet? 

C.J.
Yeah 

LEO
They were brothers. 

C.J.
What were they doing there? 

LEO
A soccer match. 

C.J.
Can we say whether or not we think they were intentional targets? 

LEO
Not yet, and we can't release their names. 

C.J.
The Levys just lost their sons. I'll take the heat for a few hours. The President'll call them? 

LEO
Yeah. 

C.J.
Can I tell them the President's been in touch with the Prime Minister? 

LEO
Yeah, but don't give them a read. The Israelis are going to do what they're going to do so ratchet 
down expectations. 

C.J.
Anything else? 

LEO
No. 

C.J.
I'm going to get in there. 

LEO
Thank you.

C.J. walks out to the hallway and meets Charlie. 

C.J.
Charlie? 

CHARLIE
Yeah? 

C.J.
Listen, I wanted to... 

CHARLIE
I can't talk about it, C.J.

C.J.
Word is, you're- 

CHARLIE
I can't talk about it. 

C.J.
We'll talk hypothetically. Say a guy your age was offered a "get out of jail free" card. 

CHARLIE
Nobody's going to jail. 

C.J.
But everybody's getting called and everybody's getting lawyers and if you took immunity- 

CHARLIE
I'd still need a lawyer. 

C.J.
For a few hours, not 100 hours. 

CHARLIE
Look- 

C.J.
I know what you're thinking. 

CHARLIE
I really can't talk about it. 

C.J.
Okay. I'm going to change my clothes. 

CHARLIE
[unflinching, and without any pause] I'll watch. 

C.J. gives Charlie a look.

CHARLIE
[whispers] No.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT 
Josh walks in.

JOSH
What the hell's going on? 

SAM
We're down four votes. 

JOSH
I thought it was one. 

SAM
Three of our guys are on airplanes, and out of reach. 

JOSH
Why? 

SAM
That's where they wanted to be. 

JOSH
Where's Kimball? 

SAM
He's on his way. Toby's waiting for him. 

DONNA
[entering] Josh. 

JOSH
Is he in there? 

DONNA
Yeah. 

JOSH
I got to go. 

SAM
Did you look at the child asthma stats? 

JOSH
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Josh walks in to meet the governor of Indiana, JACK BUCKLAND. Two other guests are with him. 

JOSH
Governor. 

JACK BUCKLAND
Josh, good to see you. 

JOSH
Sorry to interrupt dinner. 

BUCKLAND
You know Pam Wachtel and Jonathan. 

JOSH
I do. Good to see you guys. Anybody need a drink, or anything?

AIDES
I'm fine. No. 

JOSH
Thanks, Donna. So, Governor, the president's a tree-hugger? 

BUCKLAND
I never said that. 

JOSH
"If you want to save a spotted owl Vote for Bartlet, If you want to save a job, Vote for someone else"? 

BUCKLAND
I never said that either. 

JOSH
No, she did, in the Indianapolis Post-Dispatch. You weren't misquoted, right? 

PAM WACHTEL
No. 

JOSH
Okay, listen. I wouldn't know a spotted owl if he walked up and introduced himself but I do know 
the president's a pro-business pragmatist who has created 3.8 million new jobs.

PAM WACHTEL
Tell that to an unemployed steelworker in Indiana 'cause he's working three of those jobs the 
president created just to pay the mortgage. 

JOSH
The decline in manufacturing isn't because of the environment. 

JONATHAN
Of course it is. 

JOSH
Jonathan... 

JONATHAN
When the president raised standards for smog and soot emissions he raised the cost of business 
and closed down industrial plants across the Midwest. 

JOSH
You want to see a study that says if we hadn't passed the Clean Air Act two million more people 
would have suffered from heart disease, bronchitis, respiratory- 

JONATHAN
You want to see a study that says how many healthy people we've got on the unemployment line? 

JOSH
The EPA stats on child asthma alone- 

BUCKLAND
I don't want to talk about child asthma. Neither does Josh. Will the two of you excuse us, please? 

PAM and JONATHAN
Yes, sir. 

JOSH
It doesn't destroy jobs, Jack, it creates them. There's a $400 billion worldwide market in 
creating technologies that are environmentally safe. 

BUCKLAND
You think a 55-year-old steelworker's going to get a job building hybrid engines? Ask me what 
you want to know. 

JOSH
You invited Victor Campos to Indiana. 

BUCKLAND
Yeah. 

JOSH
Pam's quote in the Post-Dispatch...

BUCKLAND
Yeah. 

JOSH
Jack, are you going to challenge the president in the primary? 

BUCKLAND
Let's have that drink.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
Toby meets Congressman KIMBALL, who's on his way inside after getting out of a car.

TOBY
Took you long enough. 

KIMBALL
I was held up. 

TOBY
And I'm not about to be. 

KIMBALL
Yeah? 

TOBY
We can win this without you. 

KIMBALL
I've got four proxies in my pocket so you can't do anything without me. Don't worry about it, 
I came with a shopping list. 

TOBY
How does a Democrat from Tennessee Farm Country, where we championed electrification -- the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, farm safety nets, the... how do you do this to a democratic president? 

KIMBALL
Estate tax costs 65 cents on the dollar. 

TOBY
That's not my point. 

KIMBALL
Why would anyone want to build up-? 

TOBY
That's not my point. 

KIMBALL
Well, what's the point? 

TOBY
You were with us yesterday and now you're holding us hostage. 

KIMBALL
I've got some things I'd like to talk about and I feel I'm in a fairly strong negotiating position. 

TOBY:
What? 

KIMBALL
Grazing fees. 

TOBY
Grazing fees? 

KIMBALL
Yeah. 

TOBY
Grazing fees. Let's go; we're running out of time.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT 

C.J.
I can't confirm the names of any Americans killed. Arthur? 

ARTHUR
Is the White House ready to call the cease-fire a failure? 

C.J.
The parties themselves negotiated the terms of the cease fire, and the government of the United 
States remains committed to the peace process. 

SHERRI
C.J., What do you have to-? 

C.J.
I like to call on people, Sherri.

SHERRI
What do you have to say to the people of Dallas who have just lost two of their native sons to 
this tragedy? 

C.J.
Well, as I said earlier we can't confirm or deny the identities of any American victims of the 
bombing. 

SHERRI
How is it that the United States Government, supported by the citizens of Dallas knows less than 
CNN, AP and Israeli TV? 

C.J.
I think the citizens of Dallas will understand that the 1974 Privacy Act precludes me from 
discussing those details until the family gives its consent. Mark? 

MARK
C.J., Since two Americans were killed is the U.S. Considering retaliating themselves? 

C.J.
We're still investigating the circumstances. In the meantime, we continue to urge all parties to 
demonstrate restraint. Phil.

CUT TO: EXT. PORTICO - NIGHT 

LEO
It was a Palestinian splinter group called the Palestine Freedom Front. 

BARTLET
Agency and FBI concur? 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
And we shouldn't be looking outside the box? 

LEO
Hutchinson talked with the Israeli foreign minister and the interior minister. It was an isolated 
incident. 

BARTLET
Retaliation for Bekaa? 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
If that's the case I want to hear it from Arafat's mouth. I want to hear it from him. A denunciation 
of violence. I want to see security cooperation with the Israelis. 

LEO
We'll have the U.N. Secretary general put the screws to the chairman and Scorza can be at the prime 
minister's office. Maybe, maybe, maybe we can get Israel to hold their fire tonight. 

BARTLET
Would you? 

LEO
No.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam and Toby are meeting with Kimball.

KIMBALL
There are some 30,000 ranchers in western states who graze their sheep and cattle on Federal Lands. 

SAM
Yes, and they do it for about one-tenth of market value. 

KIMBALL
Mr. Seaborn- 

SAM
Based on an archaic formula set by Congress 30 years ago. 

KIMBALL
There was cattle 30 years ago. 

SAM
We're not trying to stick it to ranchers. We want to raise grazing fees and use the money to restore 
streams, watersheds- 

KIMBALL
Yes 

SAM
--Fish and wildlife habitats that have been destroyed by over-

KIMBALL
And how do ranchers put food on their tables? And yours, for that matter? 

SAM
It's cheaper for cattle to graze on federal lands than to feed a young basset hound. 

KIMBALL
And it's easier to sell out the western states where you're not going to win anyway than to help 
cattlemen whose prices are plummeting. If you look at the range land- 

TOBY
I don't want to look at the range land anymore. A one-year moratorium. 

KIMBALL
The president waits a year before he tries to raise the fees? 

TOBY
One year. Go vote. 

KIMBALL
No. I've got more. 

TOBY
Really? 

KIMBALL 
A GAO review of the deficiencies in the Freedom to Farm Act, and the need for a stronger Farm 
Safety Net Administration, support for an increase in production flexibility contracts and a 
promise...

Sam sneaks outside and calls on Donna.

SAM
Donna? 

DONNA
Yeah? 

SAM
I need Josh. 

DONNA
He's still in with- 

SAM
Yeah, tell him we're going to need more time. 

Donna walks into THE MURAL ROOM. Governor Buckland and Josh are inside. 

DONNA
Excuse me governor, I'm sorry. Josh? 

Josh stands and walks up to Donna.

JOSH
Yeah? 

DONNA
Sam says they need more time. 

JOSH
Tell him to call the minority leader's office. Tell him we need to stage an exhibition. 

DONNA
Will he know how that works? 

JOSH
There's a rule against exhibitions on the house floor. He'll have one of our members bring a 
poster on the floor another one of our members will object and the chair has to rule followed 
by a vote of the full house and that'll buy 20 minutes. 

DONNA
Okay. [leaves]

JOSH
[back to Buckland] So... you're polling at slightly less than five percent in Iowa. After hearing 
your issue profile that number actually goes down. 39% of caucus-goers say they wouldn't even 
consider voting for you. "Shares our values"? 18%. Did you know that? 

BUCKLAND
No. 

JOSH
In New Hampshire, you got three percent. "Shares our values," 14%. After hearing your profile, 
41% think you're a republican. Did you know that? 

BUCKLAND
No. 

JOSH
South Dakota, three percent; Georgia, eight percent; New York, seven percent. Did you know any 
of that? 

BUCKLAND
No. 

JOSH
The reason why you didn't know, Jack, is that you don't even have the money to do out-of-state 
polling right now. 

BUCKLAND
So, you helped me out. 

JOSH
I did. Now with those kinds of numbers and no kind of money how can you expect to run a campaign? 

BUCKLAND
Where were the president's numbers? And what kind of money did he have when he challenged...? 

JOSH
He wasn't challenging a sitting president and NOBODY challenges a sitting president in a primary 
by going to his right. This isn't a serious challenge you're contemplating so tell me what it is, 
Jack. 

BUCKLAND
Well, if it isn't a serious challenge what are you doing in this room? 

JOSH
Your health! We don't like your health. You're a Heisman trophy-winning football player, a U.S. 
Olympian, you still run the New York Marathon and every time we see b-roll of you tossing a ball 
around at the local boys' club it makes people think the president's got to campaign in an oxygen 
tent. 

BUCKLAND
Well, it sounds like a bit of a serious challenge. It sounds like I need to be listened to. You 
want to see me do some push-ups? 

JOSH
Yeah. That's what I want.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

LEO
What do we know? 

NANCY
Keyhole sees 12 Israeli F-15s on the tarmac at Hatzerim Air Base. 

LEO
What are they armed with? 

NANCY
Eight AIM-Sidewinders. Pilots are in the cockpits. We see heat plumes. 

ADVISOR
We also got ten Douglas A.H. Apache Longbows airborne from Betzet. They're armed with Hellfires. 

LEO
Any chance it's a training exercise? 

NANCY
It's always a training exercise. 

LEO
What do we think are the targets? 

ADVISOR
It looks like the Abu Sneni Bab and al-Sheikh neighborhoods in Hebron, a police station in 
Ramallah and al-Watan, which is the newspaper of Hamas but we could be wrong about all of that. 

LEO
Arab reaction? 

ADVISOR
Egypt will call for an immediate Arab summit if Israel retaliates. 

LEO
Nancy, what about the C-4? 

NANCY
Good, 'cause this is what's interesting. The agency indicates that the bomber had ties to Abdul 
Mujeeb. 

LEO
Really? 

NANCY
Yeah. 

LEO
Well, that may be our way out. All right, that may be it. Sally, I need to see the president. 

SALLY
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

CAROL
The networks want to take you live the next time you brief. Is that okay? 

C.J.
Yeah. 

CAROL
Sherri Wexler is about to do her stand-up. 

C.J.
The station can't send over someone who knows what they're doing? 

CAROL
She thinks she knows what she's doing. 

C.J.
I have to watch this? 

CAROL
I thought you showed great restraint in there before. 

C.J.
Walk softly... and do something else. 

CAROL
Carry a big stick. 

C.J.
Yeah. Walk softly. Walk around.

C.J. turns on the T.V.

SHERRI
[on TV] With the White House not able to confirm or deny at this point the names of the Americans 
or, in fact, if any Americans were involved at all. In the meantime, debate continues on Capitol 
Hill over the president's veto of the legislation repealing the estate tax. So, it's a tense night 
here, Alan as staffers and press burn the midnight oil. 

ALAN
Sherri, going back to the suicide bomber you say the White House can't confirm whether Americans 
were involved, yet other news outlets- 

SHERRI
Yes. I should say the press secretary C.J. Cregg can't confirm if Americans were involved. It's not 
clear the extent to which C.J.'S in the loop on this. I can tell you, she's changed her clothes 
several times throughout the evening. 

ALAN
I'm sorry, Sherri, say again? 

SHERRI
I say, C. J. Cregg's known to be a bit of a clothes horse and perhaps she's missed some information 
during one of her wardrobe changes. 

C.J.
Well... turns out she did know what she was doing. 

CAROL
You want me to take care of it? 

C.J.
I'll take care of it.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT 

SAM
Hey, Margaret.

MARGARET
He'll be here in just a minute. 

TOBY
Be back in a second. [to Charlie, who is passing by] Charlie? 

CHARLIE
I can't talk about it. 

TOBY
You don't know what I was going to say. 

CHARLIE
Immunity? 

TOBY
Yeah. 

CHARLIE
I can't talk about it. 

TOBY
I could have been talking about a flu vaccine. 

CHARLIE
That's immunization. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

LEO
[comes out] Come on. 

They enter LEO'S OFFICE.

LEO
So, what's happening in there? 

TOBY
We've given him a one-year moratorium on grazing fees, support for anincrease in the production 
flexibility contracts a promise not to lower agricultural export subsidies. We're up to a tougher 
FDA crackdown on the illegal use of antibiotics in milk. 

LEO
Are you kid-? 

TOBY
I swear to God. 

LEO
How's Buckland? 

JOSH
He wants a seat at the table, that's for sure. 

TOBY
How far do we go with these guys? 

JOSH
Can I offer Buckland-? 

LEO
No. 

JOSH
Well, he's going to keep mouthing off- 

LEO
[annoyed] I don't care, take him out! Enough's enough. First, Victor Campos then Kimball and his 
band of four, then Buckland? Let him know we're going to put it out he tried to Blackmail the 
President unless he caved to industry on clean air, clean water climate control, and worker safety. 
Emphasize worker safety. That'll get him in good with the unions. 

JOSH
Everyone will know the leak came from us. 

LEO
Yeah. You know what? Bill Russell was getting eaten alive 'cause they could never get him to 
throw an elbow. He didn't want to do it. So, Red Auerbach told him to do it one time. "Throw an 
elbow in a nationally televised game. You'll never have to do it again." You bet your ass they'll 
know the leak came from us. Toby, whatever's on the table in there... take it or leave it. 

TOBY
Yes, sir. 

SAM
Thank you. 

TOBY
Thanks, Leo. 

Toby walks out and Sam catches up with him.

SAM
[to Toby] Hang on. 

TOBY
What? 

SAM
Listen- 

TOBY
Yeah? 

SAM
What's on the table, don't you...? Grazing fees, farm nets, milk subsidies--what's on the table. 
Aren't they the same things a farm district republican would want? 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM
Let's offer it to them. 

TOBY
Offer it to who? 

SAM
Republicans. Royce. He'll carry six Republicans. That'll be seven votes. First off, when Kimball 
and his four see we're going to win, they'll hop onboard so we've got a bigger margin. Second, 
C.J. can make a big deal out of bipartisanship but mostly- 

TOBY
We threw an elbow. 

SAM
On national TV. 

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Kimball waits as Toby and Sam return.

KIMBALL
We were talking about a tougher FDA crackdown on illegal uses of antibiotics in milk such as 
excess dosages of- 

TOBY
No. 

KIMBALL
Well, I wouldn't be so quick to say no. 

TOBY
I think I will. 

KIMBALL
No to the FDA crackdown? 

TOBY
No to everything. 

KIMBALL
What do you mean? 

TOBY
I mean no to the FDA crackdown, no to lower agricultural subsidies, no to the production flexibility 
contracts, no to the GAO review, and the president will seek to raise the grazing fees at any time 
he sees fit. We're going to need the room. Would you mind, Congressman. 

KIMBALL
Well- 

SAM
Congressman? We're a little pressed for time. 

KIMBALL
Good luck. 

SAM
Thank you very much. 

TOBY
[loud enough for Kirkland to hear] Ginger! We need congressman Robert Royce, Republican of 
Pennsylvania, on the phone. 

SAM
Okay, well... now this really needs to work. 

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bartlet walks in to his sick wife, who is lying on the bed.

BARTLET
Hey. How you feeling? 

ABBEY
You shouldn't get too close. 

BARTLET
It's all right. 

ABBEY
I'm like a Petri dish over here. 

BARTLET
Yeah, you're pretty gross. 

ABBEY
How's the dinner? 

BARTLET
It's good... but... a suicide bomber got two American kids in Jerusalem. 

ABBEY
No. 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

ABBEY
Were they targeted? 

BARTLET
We're pretty sure. We got some things going. 

ABBEY
How old were they? 

BARTLET
19 and 21. They were brothers. You speak to Zoey today? 

ABBEY
No. 

BARTLET
I thought the deal was she calls once a day. 

ABBEY
She calls most days. 

BARTLET
I want her to call every day. 

ABBEY
All right. 

BARTLET
All right. You need anything? 

ABBEY
No. 

BARTLET
Okay.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT
	FRIDAY EVENING
Leo is perched on a windowsill on the portico. He stands up when Bartlet walks through the door 
leading to the Residence.

LEO
We can connect the bomber to Abdul Mujeeb.

BARTLET
How?

LEO
Traces of C-4 and other chemicals that are tagged.

Bartlet sits down on the windowsill.

BARTLET
So you think I get on the phone with the Chairman and...

Leo sits down next to Bartlet.

LEO
I think you get on the phone and I think you tell him to hand Abdul Mujeeb over to the Israelis. 
You remind him Israeli secret police are gonna kill him anyway.

BARTLET
It's gonna take more than that.

LEO
If it does, you tell him...

BARTLET
Congress?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
We'll withhold the $100 million in NGO aid if they don't hand him over?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
And you think handing him over puts the pin back in the grenade?

LEO
For a day.

BARTLET
For a day?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
[nods] All right. Set up the call.

Bartlet and Leo both stand up.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet walks back inside through the door to the Residence. Leo walks toward the Oval Office.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT

BUCKLAND
This isn't...

JOSH
Hang on-

BUCKLAND
Wait.

JOSH
Hang on--

BUCKLAND
No, you hang on, Josh. I'm the Governor of Indiana. You hang on. You're sayin' I should get out 
of the race 'cause I'm too healthy, and you're tellin' me I'm makin' a flaky argument?

JOSH
I didn't say...

BUCKLAND
How am I supposed to keep advocating the issues that I care about if I don't get into the race 
for a while?

JOSH
You...

There's a knock on the door and it opens. Josh turns slightly in the direction of the door 
where Donna is standing.

DONNA
I'm so sorry, Josh...

JOSH
Yeah.

Josh stands up and walks over to the where she's standing. Buckland looks mildly annoyed. 
Josh and Donna stand facing each other in the hall with the door open.

DONNA
Sam needs more time.

JOSH
All right. Tell him to have a Democrat call for a journal vote. If a member calls for a journal 
vote, the full House has to approve the previous day's floor activity."

DONNA
[scribbling on a notepad] Okay.

JOSH
After that, he can have a member try to attach an amendment to the override vote.

DONNA
What kind of amendment?

JOSH
Doesn't matter. "To qualify for the estate tax repeal, the estates have to have Astroturf™."

DONNA
And still it's hard to figure why Congress can't get anything done.

Donna walks off to find Sam. Josh turns and walks slowly back into the Mural Room, closing the 
door behind him.

JOSH
I'm sorry.

BUCKLAND
No, that's all right. There's a lot goin' on here tonight.

Josh sits down slowly, trying to look humble and gracious. Buckland puts his drink down on the 
table next to his chair.

JOSH
No, I meant...I'm sorry. [pause] You came through for us in Indiana. Really, the whole Midwest. 
You would've been great in the number two spot. And it was me as much as anyone pushing Hoynes.

BUCKLAND
You couldn't win without Hoynes.

JOSH
Yeah.

BUCKLAND
I'm term-limited, Josh, and I still have things I want to say.

JOSH
[quietly] Listen, I have instructions to...you know...

BUCKLAND
To bust me.

JOSH
Yeah.

Buckland allows a whisper of a grin to appear on his face.

JOSH
If I could convince Leo to put you on the short list...think you could say what you want to say?

BUCKLAND
You can't offer me quid pro quo; it's against the law.

JOSH
I know. But I can tell you that Carl Reed wants to accept a position at Shearson, and he'll be 
leaving in about three months.

BUCKLAND
You guys are that afraid of my health, huh?

Buckland allows a bit more of a grin to emerge and leans forward a bit in his chair.

JOSH
Well, we're afraid of everything. [laughs and sighs simultaneously, pauses] But no kidding, Jack, 
I-I, I think you'd make an interesting nominee for Labor Secretary.

Buckland leans forward a little more.

JOSH
So if I could convince Leo...

BUCKLAND
I'm gonna go see if there's any dessert left.

Buckland extends his hand to Josh and they shake hands.

JOSH
Thank you, Governor.

Buckland stands up and leaves. Josh looks pensive.

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Congressman ROBERT ROYCE is seated at the head of the table, with Toby and Sam seated on either side.

ROBERT ROYCE
I want to make sure I understand this. You're offering a one-year moratorium on grazing fees...

SAM
Yeah.

ROYCE
...a GAO review of the need for a stronger farm safety net...

SAM
Yeah.

ROYCE
...a promise not to lower agricultural export subsidies...

SAM
Yeah.

ROYCE
...and a tougher FDA crackdown on what?

SAM
The illegal use of antibiotics in milk.

ROYCE
In exchange for my vote to sustain the veto?

TOBY
And the six that come with you.

ROYCE
And this is the exact same deal you were offering to Kimball?

TOBY
Yes.

ROYCE
And he was ready to take it?

TOBY
Yes.

ROYCE
[firmly, glaring at Toby] I don't want it.

Royce takes a sip of coffee and sets his mug back down on the table. Toby glances across the 
table at Sam. They both remain fairly calm.

TOBY
Congressman, you've been uneasy about the estate tax from the beginning.

ROYCE
That's right, I have. And yet, the White House did what it always does: it went to the extreme 
flank of its own party. Which meant more arm-wrestling, more dealmaking, God knows how many 
billions wasted in pork-barrel promises...

SAM
What are you saying?

ROYCE
That the moderates get shut out! Let me tell you something. The idea of repealing the estate tax 
makes me embarrassed to be a Republican. We used to be about the sensible center, about fiscal 
discipline. A tax break for billionaires? [scoffs] Of course this thing should be vetoed! 
It was a Republican named Oliver Wendell Holmes who said, "Taxes are the price we pay for a 
civilized society."

TOBY
Are you saying...

ROYCE
Don't target me for defeat. I'm vulnerable in my district. The DNC'll run a conservative Democrat. 
If he's elected, he won't even be photographed with the President, much less vote with him. Take 
a look around at all the Democrats running from you right now. [pauses] Do you even know who your 
friends are anymore?

Sam and Toby take this is for a few moments.

TOBY
If we do our best to see that you're not seriously challenged...

ROYCE
You have seven new votes tonight. [pauses] Oh, and, uh...throw in the milk thing.

TOBY
[stands up, shakes his hand] Go vote, Congressman.

Sam shakes the Congressman's hand. Royce leaves.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
As Royce walks briskly down the hall, he passes Leo, who's walking in the opposite direction. 
Leo gives Royce a mild questioning look.

ROYCE
You're home.

Royce keeps walking. Leo walks over to the doorway of the Roosevelt Room. Toby and Sam are standing 
around the table gathering up their things. They both look up. Leo gives them a proud smile. Toby 
doesn't really react, but Sam smiles back. Leo turns and spots Charlie in the hallway.

LEO
[to Charlie] You. Get in here.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Charlie walks in ahead of Leo, who closes the door behind him. They stand in the middle of the 
office facing each other.

LEO
[kindly but firmly] Take the immunity.

CHARLIE
I'm not allowed...

LEO
Take it.

CHARLIE
Is anyone else taking it?

LEO
No one else is being offered it.

CHARLIE
Would they take it if they were?

LEO
Charlie, who the hell knows what's gonna happen with this prosecution? It's a partisan prosecution. 
You could go broke! You could be barred from law school!

Charlie looks concerned.

CHARLIE
Doesn't immunity imply guilt?

LEO
Not necessarily.

CHARLIE
And if someone in my position took a deal to protect himself...what would that person be saying to 
his employer? That they were wrong to trust him.

LEO
[a little annoyed] Don't be a hero.

CHARLIE
Why not? 

Leo looks a bit surprised.

CHARLIE
I'll stay with my team. People should stop trying to get me not to do that.

There's a knock on the door. It opens and Margaret walks into the office.

MARGARET
Leo?

Leo glances over at her but doesn't say anything. He's still staring, slightly stunned, at Charlie.

CHARLIE
[with a glint in his eye] Anyway, I'm not supposed to talk about it.

LEO
[nods] Yeah. Okay.

Charlie turns and leaves via the door to the Oval Office. Leo watches him leave.

MARGARET
Nancy.

LEO
Thanks.

Margaret shows Nancy in, closes the door, and goes back to her desk. Nancy looks pleased, but in a 
fairly subdued way.

LEO
What are you smiling about?

NANCY
Palestinian police arrested Mujeeb at his residence in Gaza.

Leo looks very relieved.

LEO
Margaret?

Margaret enters.

MARGARET
Yeah?

LEO
[smiling slightly] Get me C.J. on the phone... And see if there's still any food over there.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Josh walks in, through the door across from her desk, fiddling with his bow tie. Donna is standing 
behind her desk, organizing papers.

JOSH
I got away with this thing, but you should really learn how to tie a bow tie. He tosses the tie 
on her desk.

DONNA
[weakly] Or you could.

JOSH
Yeah, but that doesn't seem that likely, right? You can go home.

He starts to walk toward his office.

DONNA
I'll stick around.

She walks over to a file cabinet and picks up a folder, then walks back behind her desk. He suddenly 
turns around and walks back toward her desk.

JOSH
[a little impatiently] You wanted to talk to me about something before.

DONNA
[forcing a weak smile] Yeah...Listen...I was fixed up on a blind date a few nights ago.

She suddenly has his full attention. He's leaning on the doorframe next to her desk, his body 
language barely concealing his sense of unease and anger.

JOSH
When?

DONNA
A few nights ago...

Josh is shifting from side to side, looking more and more uncomfortable and trying to control 
himself.

DONNA
...and Ainsley fixed us up. He's a Republican lawyer working for Ways and Means but he was 
being transferred. And it turns out now... [sighs, tries to adopt a light tone] ...that he's 
on Government Oversight-

JOSH
[firmly] You can't see him anymore.

DONNA
[serious] I know that.

JOSH
You can't see him anymore.

DONNA
I know that.

JOSH
It was just that night?

DONNA
Yeah. [pauses] No... [sighs] We got together the next night again. We shouldn't have.

Josh isn't looking at her. He's lowered his eyes and he's channeling as much frustration as he 
can bear to reveal into fumbling with the top button on his shirt.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
[looking scared] Look, when we got together the first time...

Josh finally manages to open the collar of his shirt and finally looks up at her. Disappointment 
and betrayal and hurt are infused in his voice.

JOSH
You just thought he was with Ways and Means who I was battling on the estate tax.

DONNA
I'm sorry...

JOSH
Did any reporters see you?

DONNA
No.

JOSH
The second night?

DONNA
No. 

Josh stares at her coldly.

JOSH
All right. You can go home.

DONNA
[disheartened] The President wants you in five minutes.He stares at her for several moments.

JOSH
Thanks.

He turns and walks into his office, closing the door firmly behind him. Donna is still standing 
behind her desk.

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
C.J. is briefing from the podium. Carol is standing beside her.

PHIL
C.J.?

OTHER REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Phil.

PHIL
Did the President urge the Chairman to hand over Abdul Mujeeb?

C.J.
As I said, the President urged the parties to abide by the terms of the cease-fire and he reiterated 
the United States's commitment to the peace process.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Katie.

KATIE
C.J., and AP report out of Gaza says the President threatened to withhold more than $100 million 
dollars to Palestinian NGOs unless the Chairman handed over Mujeeb.

C.J.
Well, I'm not gonna get into the details of the diplomatic exchange. There'll be more on that 
tomorrow. I'm told at this moment the House is getting ready to vote on the override of the 
President's veto, and I know you'll all want to cover that. Since this is the President's first 
veto, I thought it might be helpful if we brushed up on the rules. Sherri, can you tell us how 
many votes it takes to override a veto?

SHERRI
[surprised] I'm sorry?

C.J.
How many votes does it take to override, Sherri?

SHERRI
A majority.

C.J.
Actually, it takes two thirds.

SHERRI
Yes, a two-thirds majority.

C.J.
Yeah, 290. And how many votes does it take to sustain?

Sherri gives C.J. a quizzical look.

C.J.
That should be easy. You just subtract 290 from the total number of members in the House, and add one.

Sherri nods.

C.J.
How many people sit in the House of Representatives, Sherri?

The other reporters all turn to look at Sherri, who looks fairly uncomfortable and remains silent.

C.J.
Okay, maybe you can get the notes from a classmate. That's all, guys. I'll see you in the morning.

C.J. and Carol leave the room.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Carol scurries up behind C.J., who's walking briskly through the hall.

CAROL
They're meeting in the Oval Office.

C.J.
Thanks.

Sherri comes out of the Press Room and walks after C.J.

SHERRI
C.J.?

C.J.
Hey.

SHERRI
That was totally uncalled for.

C.J. keeps walking.

C.J.
Yeah?

SHERRI
My competitors are gonna show that tape. Every local station in town...

C.J. stops walking to face Sherry.

C.J.
What? Are you crazy? That thing's going out to 154 affiliates!

SHERRI
Look...

C.J.
I changed my clothes because I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about the death of two 
teenagers while wearing a ball gown, and you knew that. Because you're stupid, but you're not 
stupid, you know what I'm saying? Security's gonna take your press credentials. You'll call my 
office every day and I'll decide if you get into the room. I'm taking your spot on Pebble Beach - 
you can do your stand-ups from Lafayette Park.

SHERRI
Who the hell...

C.J.
One more word out of your mouth and every local station in town but yours gets an exclusive with 
the President. Hunting season on me is over.

Sherri glares at her and leaves.

C.J.
[quietly] And the chemical abbreviation for table salt is NaCl.

C.J. walks off, presumably to the meeting in the Oval Office.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
It's nearing dawn on Saturday. Bartlet, Leo, Toby, Sam, and Josh are sitting on the sofas and 
side chairs. They all look quite tired. Bartlet nods slightly as the others talk.

SAM
[to Bartlet] You could say...you could say, "On behalf of Abbey and myself, please accept our 
deepest condolences. Your sons' lives were not lost in vain."

JOSH
They were lost in vain.

SAM
What I meant was that this calls national attention to the peace process.

C.J. knocks softly on the door and comes in. Leo nods at her. She sits down next to Sam.

SAM
"Though tragic, this tragedy further calls national attention to this...alarming, escalating conflict."

TOBY
Is there anything to: "They went there in the spirit of peace"?

C.J.
The spirit of peace, at a soccer match? Hope of Israeli and Palestinian children playing together and...

JOSH
Studying together, discovering each other's worlds...

They all glance at Bartlet, who looks very pensive and somber. 

BARTLET
This guy at the dinner, he told me something I didn't know. On Yom Kippur, you ask forgiveness for 
sins against God. But on the day before, you ask forgiveness for sins against people. 
[looks over at Toby] Did you know that?

TOBY
Yeah. It's called, uh...I can't remember...

JOSH
It's... Erev.

TOBY
Erev Yom Kippur.

BARTLET
[nods] You can't ask forgiveness of God until you've asked forgiveness of people on the day before. 

Charlie knocks and opens the door.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
[looks up at Charlie] Yeah?

Charlie points toward the phone.

BARTLET
Yeah, I'm gonna do this alone. Have a good night, everybody.

ALL
Thank you, Mr. President.

They all stand up and file out. Bartlet walks over to his desk and sits down. He picks up the 
receiver but pauses for a few moments to collect his thoughts. He lets out a deep sigh and hits 
the button on the phone.

BARTLET
[sadly] Mr. and Mrs. Levy, this is Jed Bartlet. I have three children. I really don't know what to say.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
