TEASER 

The intro to Don Henley's "New York Minute" plays.

FADE IN: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - EARLY MORNING

FADE TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
A staffer delivers mail.

FADE TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Two White House guards changes shifts.

FADE TO: HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Leo enters.


	Lying here in the darkness
	I hear the sirens wail
	Somebody’s going to emergency
	Somebody’s going to jail.


CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Sam is sleeping on couch.


	If you find somebody to love in the world
	You better hang on tooth and nail
	The wolf is always at the door.


Leo looks in and sees Sam. 


	In a New York Minute, everything can change
	In a New York minute...


LEO 
Sam?

The song continues, Sam wakes up. 

SAM 
What day is this? 

LEO 
It’s Friday. 

SAM 
I’m sorry. I meant... I’m sorry. What time is it? 

LEO 
You sleep here last night? 

SAM 
I’m sorry? 

LEO 
You slept here? 

SAM 
I don’t have a couch in my office. 

LEO 
Yeah, but you have a bed in your house, right? 

The song fades out. 

SAM 
I need to change my shirt. 

LEO 
Maybe you need to go home for a while. 

SAM 
What are you doing here so early? 

LEO 
Trying to avoid the protesters. Metro police closed a four-block radius around the World 
Bank and made Pennsylvania Avenue one way from M to 21st. 

They exit Toby’s office and walk through THE WEST WING. 

LEO
Seventeenth and 15th are closed to Independence Avenue and Constitution’s closed between 
23rd and the Ellipse. 

SAM 
Did you take Dupont? 

LEO 
Dupont had two turns closed off with metal barricades and cop cars. So, I took P to Logan 
Circle, which was also blocked. So, I made a U-turn and doubled back to get on 16th, where 
there was a police cordon around the National Geographic Society. 

They enter LEO'S OFFICE. 

SAM 
Who has a problem with the National Geographic Society? 

LEO 
That’s exactly what I want to know. 

SAM 
Anyway, I’m going to change my shirt. 

LEO 
What’s going on with the pardon recommendations? 

SAM 
They’re coming together. I’ve reviewed the recommendations from Justice and the OPA and 
Tribbey’s office had its own recommendations. 

LEO 
How many are you sending in? 

SAM 
Eighteen, I think, now. Mail fraud, securities fraud, and truly the most bogus drug bust 
I’ve ever seen. 

LEO 
Don’t retry the cases. 

SAM 
I’m not retrying the cases. I’m reading the material I’m supposed to read. I’m making the 
recommendations I’m supposed to make. The guy was tried in Spain and found guilty of a 
crime he was obviously too stupid to commit. 

LEO 
Sam, go home, would you? 

SAM 
No, I’m just going to change my shirt. 

LEO 
You look bad. You’re tired, you slept in the office. It’s Friday. Go home. 

SAM 
Why? 

LEO 
‘Cause I think you’re putting too much faith in the magical powers of a new shirt. 

SAM 
Leo. 

LEO 
Josh told me what happened... with your parents. Sam... 

SAM 
Yeah? 

LEO 
My father had affairs. 

SAM 
Did he? 

LEO 
Yeah. 

SAM 
My father didn’t pick up a cocktail waitress, Leo. He’s had a woman in an apartment in 
Santa Monica... 

LEO 
Yeah? 

SAM 
...for 28 years. 

LEO 
How’d he get caught? 

SAM 
My father, it turns out, is stupider than the guy in Spain. So, the real question is how 
did he not get caught until now? 

LEO 
Yeah. 

SAM 
Anyway, I’ll see you at the staff meeting later. 

Sam leaves the office, enters the YELLOW HALL. 

LEO 
[calls after him] Sam. 

Leo joins Sam in the hall, and they walk.

SAM 
Yeah? 

LEO 
When did you find out? 

SAM 
Tuesday. 

LEO 
You slept here the last three nights? 

SAM 
No. 

LEO 
Seriously, man, go home. 

SAM 
No, I’m going to check the final OPA list. In fact, I’ll be checking it twice... 
see who’s been naughty, see who’s been nice. 

LEO 
Sam. 

SAM 
Life goes on, Leo. Certainly the Federal Government does, so... Thanks, but let’s drop 
it, okay? 

LEO 
Yeah. 

SAM 
They’re expecting trouble at the National Geographic Society? 

LEO 
I have no explanation. 

SAM 
Well, those little postcards they stick in the subscription magazines drive me out of 
my mind, so, maybe... 

LEO 
Yeah. 

SAM 
I’ll see you later.

Sam enters the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. 

GINGER 
Hey, Sam. [into phone] This is Ginger, it’s 6:35. I’ve opened the Communications Office. 

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE 

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 

JOSH [VO] 
It’s a good speech. 

LEO [VO] 
The Andrew Jackson speech? 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

LEO 
It is a good speech. 

JOSH 
And it gets better every year. But... 

LEO 
What? 

JOSH 
You’re not going to give it, right? 

LEO 
Sure. 

JOSH 
Why? 

LEO 
Because it’s Big Block of Cheese Day, Josh. 

They exit the office, walk through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. 

JOSH 
Yeah, see, but we know it’s Big Block of Cheese Day. And we know why it’s called Big 
Block of Cheese Day. So, there’s really no need for the speech. 

LEO 
Except it wouldn’t be Big Block of Cheese Day without the speech, now, would it? 

JOSH 
Well, let’s find out. Maybe it would. 

LEO 
How did you get to work this morning? 

JOSH 
I walked. 

LEO 
Ah. 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

LEO 
How is it out there? 

JOSH 
Uh, it’s pretty loud. 

LEO 
World Policy Studies is holding a forum this morning. I’m going to send Toby. 

JOSH 
That’s a good idea. 

LEO 
Why? 

JOSH 
Well, ‘cause you’re not sending me. 

LEO 
Look, I... 

JOSH 
Leo, the World Bank and the WTO are international organizations of which the U.S. is one 
member. Why isn’t Switzerland the one? 

LEO 
‘Cause they’re not protesting in Switzerland... they’re protesting on 18th Street, and 
I don’t want to be asked how come no one from the White House ever met with them. 

JOSH 
Well, that seems reasonable. 

LEO 
I can’t tell you how relieved I am to have your approval on that. 

JOSH 
But you’re still going to do the speech. 

They stop outside the Roosevelt Room. 

LEO 
Got to. Little thing called team morale, Josh. You gotta make people feel good about 
themselves.

Leo and Josh enter THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Approximately 35 staffers are standing or sitting 
at the table. 

LEO 
All right, shut the hell up, everybody. I’ve fired more people than you before breakfast.

Complete silence ensues. Leo goes to stand at the head of the table. 

LEO 
Andrew Jackson,... [staffers groan] ...in the main foyer of the White House had a big 
block of cheese. The block of cheese was huge... 

C.J. 
Leo, who made these assignments? 

LEO 
I think this will go faster if I’m not interrupted, don’t you? 

C.J. 
I’m meeting with the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality? 

MARGARET 
Yes. 

C.J. 
What do mapmakers have to do with social equality? 

LEO 
I guess you’re about to find out. 

C.J. 
Well, probably not, because I won’t really be listening to them. 

LEO 
The block of cheese was huge...

LARRY 
Excuse me, Leo. C.J., I got NIH research funding for cancer treatment using shark 
cartilage, if you want to trade. 

ED 
I’ll take that.

LARRY 
What do you got? 

ED 
Citizens for D.C. Statehood. 

LARRY 
Forget it. 

DONNA 
I’ve got the Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle Society, but I’m keeping it. 

LEO 
You’re all keeping it. I’m sure Margaret worked long and hard to make sure that the 
appropriate petitioner went to the appropriate staffer. 

Margaret shakes head ‘no’, Leo turns to look at her, and she nods ‘yes’. 

LEO 
The block of cheese was two tons, and was there for any and all who might be hungry... 

TOBY 
[enters] Excuse me. I was waylaid. 

C.J. 
By what? 

TOBY 
30,000 tourists. 

LARRY 
You know, the protesters. 

TOBY 
No, don’t call them protesters, I’ve seen better organized crowds at the DMV. 

LEO 
Two tons this block of cheese weighed...

TOBY 
[still muttering] In my day, we knew how to protest. 

C.J. 
What day was that? 

TOBY 
1968. 

JOSH 
How the hell old were you when you were protesting? 

TOBY 
My sisters took me. [staffers chuckle] Anybody have a problem with that? 

LEO 
No one has a problem with that. 

TOBY 
The police are always seven steps ahead of them. The cops know exactly where they’re 
going to be and what’s going to happen. You know how they know? By logging onto their 
website. We had the underground. We had rapid response. 

C.J. 
And by God, you were home by supper on a school night. 

TOBY 
These people are amateurs. What’s my assignment? 

LEO 
Meeting with the amateurs. 

TOBY 
Huh? 

LEO 
World Policy Studies is having a forum... there’ll be about a hundred of them. 

TOBY 
Doing what? 

LEO 
Listening to you conduct a free exchange of ideas. 

TOBY 
Really? 

LEO 
Josh thinks it’s a good idea. 

TOBY 
Oh well, if Josh thinks it’s a good idea, then you bet, I’ll do it. 

LEO 
Look... 

TOBY 
What else is there? 

C.J. 
I’ve got Cartographers for Social Equality. 

JOSH 
So, now you have two choices... meeting with an unruly mob or meeting with lunatic 
mapmakers. 

TOBY 
Or getting paid a lot more money working almost anywhere else I want. 

LEO 
Seriously, Toby, there’ll be security there. But still... 

TOBY 
What about press? 

C.J. 
Just wires. 

TOBY 
No, I mean T.V. 

C.J. 
No cameras.

TOBY 
You negotiated that? 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
They agreed to it? 

C.J. 
You want to make out with me right now, don’t you? 

TOBY 
Well, when don’t I? [to Margaret] Give me the thing. 

LEO 
Okay, then. Andrew Jackson in the main foyer of the White House had a two-ton block 
of cheese. 

JOSH 
And a wheat thin the size of Lake Tahoe. 

The staffers giggle. An aide hands Donna a note. 

LEO 
It was there for any and all who were hungry. It was there for the voiceless, the faceless... 

Donna leaves.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Donna exits to the hallway, where STEPHANIE GAULT is waiting. 

DONNA 
Stephanie. 

STEPHANIE GAULT
[whispering] Hi. You look great. 

DONNA 
Thank you. Why are you talking like that? 

STEPHANIE 
I don’t want to shout. 

DONNA 
But we can use our normal voices though, right? 

STEPHANIE 
Never been in the White House. 

DONNA 
If you wait till later tonight, I’ll give you a tour. 

STEPHANIE 
Did I get you out of something? 

DONNA 
No, I meant we’re not allowed to give tours until after 10:00 when the President’s out 
of the west wing. 

STEPHANIE 
Oh. 

DONNA 
Come with me. 

STEPHANIE 
The President works until 10:00? 

DONNA 
He usually works until after that, but he leaves the Oval at 10. We’ll go in Josh’s office.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

STEPHANIE 
Donna, I am getting you out of something though, right? 

DONNA 
Nothing, you got me out of the Big Block of Cheese Day meeting. 

STEPHANIE 
What’s...?

DONNA 
I had the worst feeling you were going to ask. Andrew Jackson, while he was President, 
had in the main foyer of the White House - I can’t believe I’m giving this speech - 
a two-ton block of cheese. In that spirit, Leo McGarry designates one day for certain 
senior staff members to take appointments with people or groups that wouldn’t ordinarily 
be able to get the ear of the White House.

STEPHANIE 
Sounds amazing. 

DONNA 
We make a lot of fun of it but truth is, I think it is. 

STEPHANIE 
Um, I’m sorry to, uh... 

DONNA 
Oh, yeah. 

Donna closes the door, comes back and sits across from Stephanie. 

STEPHANIE 
Were you able to mention me to Sam Seaborn? 

DONNA 
I wasn’t... I haven’t yet and I apologize. 

STEPHANIE 
No, that’s okay. 

DONNA 
Sam’s just... it’s been a bad week for Sam. 

STEPHANIE 
It’s just that from everything I’ve been told, the President listens to Sam Seaborn when 
it comes to... 

DONNA 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
I should have said this on the phone. I’m not that comfortable with... 

STEPHANIE 
That’s.... 

DONNA 
It puts him in an awkward position if he has to say "no," and something like this, if it 
seems like a favor... [beat] Steph, is your dad dying? 

Stephanie nods softly. 

DONNA 
Okay, listen. When we’re in with Sam, mention what you’ve just said before, that from 
everything you’ve heard, he’s the man. He’ll want to impress you and show you that he’s 
got access to the President. 

STEPHANIE 
Wait a minute. You’re really getting me in to see him? It’s really all right? 

DONNA 
Yeah, it’s Big Block of Cheese Day. [picks up phone] It’s me. I need some time with Sam.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO 

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

BARTLET 
I don’t really need to see the ten-year numbers.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

STAFFER 
We think it’d be a good idea to take a look at them, sir. 

BARTLET 
Have the ten-year projections ever been close to accurate?

STAFFER 
Depends on what you mean by ‘close’. 

BARTLET 
Within a trillion dollars.

STAFFER 
No, sir, but we’d like you to take a look at them anyway. 

BARTLET 
Okay. Bring me the ten-year projection, a Ouija board and a magic wand.

STAFFER 
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. 

Bartlet enters the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. 

BARTLET 
What’s next? 

CHARLIE 
Sir, I need just a moment to discuss a fax that’s coming through. 

BARTLET 
From whom? 

CHARLIE 
Jonathan Bartlet. 

They enter THE OVAL OFFICE. 

BARTLET 
That name sounds familiar. 

CHARLIE 
He’s your brother. 

BARTLET 
Yes. I remember being locked in a steamer trunk. 

CHARLIE 
That doesn’t sound so bad. 

BARTLET 
There were actual steamers in there with me, Charlie. I was in there with seafood. 

CHARLIE 
Okay. Well, here’s the thing, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
We lost the site. 

CHARLIE 
You lost the first choice. 

BARTLET 
Why? 

CHARLIE 
Your brother’s been speaking with Neda Wallin, counsel to the Bartlet Presidential Library 
Commission and apparently the site violates the Historic Barn and Bridges Preservation Act. 

BARTLET 
Which says? 

CHARLIE 
I’ve got it here in my notes. "Requires that all non-housing farm and ranch structures 
built prior to 1900 be preserved by the owners unless destroyed by an act of God". 

BARTLET 
What plaid flannel-wearing, cheese-eating, yahoo of a milkman governor signed that idiot 
bill into state law? [beat, while Charlie keeps his eyes down] It was me, wasn’t it? 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
Okay. 

CHARLIE 
They’d like a green light to go ahead with the second site. 

BARTLET 
Yeah, go ahead. 

CHARLIE 
Thank you, sir. 

BARTLET 
No. 

CHARLIE 
I’m sorry? 

BARTLET 
No, don’t go ahead with the site. I just... [sighs] Tell my brother to hang on, would you? 
I’ll make a decision. I don’t know what the damn hurry is. 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY

SAM 
Bonnie, I now need the ten-year OMB projections, as well.

BONNIE 
Are those ever accurate? 

SAM 
No.

BONNIE 
And you got another call from... 

SAM 
Thanks. 

Sam takes notes, crumples it and puts it in his pocket. Donna enters with Stephanie. 

DONNA 
Sam? 

SAM 
Oh, hey. How you doing? 

DONNA 
Sam, this is Stephanie Gault. Stephanie, this is Sam. 

STEPHANIE 
It’s good to meet you. 

SAM 
Come on in. 

All three enter SAM'S OFFICE and sit down. 

DONNA 
Stephanie and I were at Wisconsin together and we bonded as the result of mutual loathing 
for the same ex-boyfriend. She’s an associate professor of International Relations at the 
Maxwell School. 

SAM 
What are you doing in town? 

STEPHANIE 
Believe it or not, I advise the WTO in certain areas of macroeconomics, so a global 
monetary crisis can’t be very far off. 

SAM 
What can I do for you? 

STEPHANIE 
[sighs] Sam, my grandfather was Daniel Gault. 

SAM 
Really? 

STEPHANIE 
Yeah. 

SAM 
[to Donna] You know who Daniel Gault was? 

DONNA 
He was a staffer here in the ‘40s. 

SAM 
He was a Special Economic Assistant to FDR and Special Liaison to State for Eastern 
European Affairs. 

STEPHANIE 
Donna knows the rest. 

DONNA 
He was jailed for espionage and died in prison six months later. 

SAM 
He wasn’t put in jail for espionage. They couldn’t make espionage. He was put in jail for 
perjury for lying in front of HUAC. 

DONNA 
Sam, Stephanie would like her grandfather included among those being considered for an 
executive pardon. 

STEPHANIE 
And from everything I’ve learned you’re the only person to speak to about this. That you 
have the ear of the President. 

SAM 
Yeah. [sighs] It’s impossible to demonstrate remorse since he’s no longer alive. 
Demonstrating his innocence is extremely complicated. 

STEPHANIE 
Yes, but you’ve already done it. 

SAM 
Excuse me? 

STEPHANIE 
You’ve already demonstrated his innocence and in an extraordinarily compelling way. 
You’ve also spoken eloquently on the need for his pardon. 

SAM 
When did I do that? 

STEPHANIE 
At Princeton, for 23 pages in the middle of your thesis. [places some papers on his desk]

SAM 
Where did you get that? 

STEPHANIE 
You sent it to my father. 

SAM 
I did. 

STEPHANIE 
I know it doesn’t seem like there should be much of a rush about getting a pardon for 
someone who’s been dead fifty years, but time’s become a factor. 

SAM 
Your father’s sick? 

STEPHANIE 
Yeah. 

SAM 
You guys want to go to the mess and get some coffee or something? 

DONNA 
Yeah.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
The protesters are on the sidewalks, yelling. Toby is sitting in a car, whistling. The 
car stops, and he rolls the window down. 

TOBY 
Toby Ziegler.

OFFICER 
Yeah.

Toby continues whistling as he gets out of car. 

CUT TO: INT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
RHONDA SACHS, another police officer, is standing by the door. 

OFFICER 
[over radio] Rhonda, this guy coming in is Toby Ziegler. 

SACHS 
Copy that. 

Toby enters. 

SACHS 
Mr. Ziegler? 

TOBY 
Yes, ma’am. 

SACHS 
Rhonda Sachs. They asked me to make sure you go home in one piece. 

TOBY 
You fully trained? 

SACHS 
Yes. 

TOBY 
How many different ways you know how to kill a man? 

SACHS 
How many different ways do I need? 

TOBY 
I like you. 

SACHS 
Thank you. 

TOBY 
Officer Sachs? 

SACHS 
Yeah? 

TOBY 
It’s going to be a day at the beach. 

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - DAY
Sam, Stephanie and Donna are at a table. Josh is sitting alone behind them, waiting. 

SAM 
You do understand how it works? 

STEPHANIE 
Yeah. 

SAM 
Recommendations come from the OPA... Office of the Pardon Attorney. Then the President 
gets into it, and more often than not, sends it to Counsel’s office for a further review. 
So... it can be a bit of a drawn-out process. 

STEPHANIE 
Yeah. 

SAM 
What I’m going to do today is speak to somebody at the Justice Department. 

STEPHANIE 
Which branch of the Justice Department? 

SAM 
The FBI. 

STEPHANIE 
Sam... 

SAM 
I know, but I won’t start in on something like this without giving them a heads-up. 

STEPHANIE 
My father requested the file in the late ‘70s and was denied. He sued under Freedom of 
Information and the judge ruled that the file couldn’t be completely disclosed because it 
met three of nine exemptions allowed. 

SAM 
National Defense and Foreign Relations Information, Internal Agency Rules and Practices, 
and Personal Privacy. 

STEPHANIE 
All of which is because the FBI is simply embarrassed about this period in their history. 

SAM 
I know, and that’s why I have to give them a heads-up. Does Donna know how to get in touch 
with you later? I’d like to tell you how it’s going. We have your number at the hotel? 

STEPHANIE 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
Actually, we’re meeting for dinner tonight. 

SAM 
Stephanie, the reason I mentioned before that it could be a drawn-out process... 

STEPHANIE 
[sighs] I understand. I just need to be able to give him some good news. He’s a s-sweet 
man in a bow tie, Sam. His father... He’s been trying for so long to... 

SAM 
Yeah. Okay, I’ll see you later then. 

Josh comes over. 

JOSH 
Hey, Steph. 

STEPHANIE 
Hey, Josh. 

DONNA 
You’re across the street in five minutes. 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

SAM 
[to Josh] I’m walking out with you. 

STEPHANIE 
Sam, thank you. 

SAM 
Yeah.

Sam and Josh exit the mess to the STAIRS. 

JOSH 
You on the Gault thing? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
That’s nice of you. I appreciate that. 

SAM 
Yeah. I’ll give the Bureau a heads-up. 

JOSH 
They’re not going to be happy about it. 

SAM 
No kidding. 

JOSH 
Did you know that Lincoln signed a pardon on the day he was assassinated? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
You know the guy’s name? 

SAM 
Patrick Murphy. 

JOSH 
You know what he was pardoned for? 

SAM 
Being a Union deserter. 

JOSH 
Am I annoying you? 

SAM 
A little bit, yeah. 

JOSH 
I was trying to make you laugh. 

SAM 
I appreciate that. Can I see your friend at the FBI? 

JOSH 
Yeah. Can I tell him why? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
Hey, you want to have a lot of fun? Seriously. Sit in on C.J.’s meeting with the 
Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality. 

SAM 
Where’s the social inequality in cartography? 

JOSH 
I don’t know. That’s why I’m going. 

SAM 
You’ll call the guy? 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

SAM 
Thanks. 

JOSH 
That a new shirt? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
Nice.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE 

FADE IN: INT. A SMALL AUDITORIUM - DAY
The protesters are gathered, yelling. Toby and Rhonda are on stage in the front. 

TOBY 
Fire your gun. 

SACHS 
I can’t fire a warning shot indoors. 

TOBY 
No, I mean fire at them. [beat] Just kidding. 

TOBY 
[to lead protester Webber] Hey, Solzhenitsyn. Come here. You’re the group leader?

TERRY WEBBER 
Yeah, I am. I’m Terry Webber. 

TOBY 
You know what you did today that was really stupid? You gave away the cameras. With 
cameras in here I’ve got a problem ‘cause I don’t want to look like I can’t control 
the crowd. Without the cameras, I can sit here, read the sports section for two hours, 
walk outside and say we talked. So, if you guys want to talk, that’s fine. But you’re 
in charge of crowd control, know what I’m saying?

WEBBER 
Yeah. [over bullhorn] Folks. People, let’s listen up. 

The yelling subsides. 

TOBY 
Good morning... [microphone doesn’t work, raises voice] Good morning, my name is Toby 
Ziegler and I’m the White House Communications Director and a senior domestic policy 
advisor to the President.

PROTESTER 1 
Advise him we need clean air more than free trade!

Yelling begins again. 

PROTESTER 2 
How many 12-year-olds made your shoes, Toby!?

GROUP 
Global justice now! Global justice now! Global justice now! 

TOBY 
[to Sachs] You want to send out for pizza or something? 

GROUP 
Global justice now! Global justice now! 

Toby sits down with a newspaper and puts his feet on the table.

CUT TO: INT. FBI BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
Sam walks to the front desk.

RECEPTIONIST 
Yes, sir? 

SAM 
I’m here to see Special Agent Casper. My name is Sam Seaborn. 

RECEPTIONIST 
Seaborn? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

RECEPTIONIST 
I’m sorry, I’m not seeing your name here. Agent Casper knows you’re coming? 

SPECIAL AGENT MIKE CASPER 
[from down the hall] Sam. 

CUT TO: INT. CASPER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Sam and Casper enter.

SAM 
How are you doing, Mike? 

Casper slams the door, and both sit down.

CASPER 
Just requesting the file on Daniel Gault is so wildly outside the parameters of your 
authority as a political appointee... 

SAM 
I came here to... 

CASPER 
Listen... 

SAM 
Mike, you guys got it wrong and you know it. 

CASPER 
Really? 

SAM 
Yes.

CASPER 
What else do I know? 

SAM 
Michael, I gave you the heads-up as a courtesy. I don’t need your permission to go to 
the OPA. I don’t need your permission to tell the press why I did. 

CASPER 
Sam, the guy did six months for a capital crime. Now you want to get him a Presidential 
pardon? 

SAM 
He did six months for perjury before vexingly dying of a heart attack. 

CASPER 
You know why? 

SAM 
‘Cause the prosecutor couldn’t make espionage. 

CASPER 
That’s right. 

SAM 
Well, why do you suppose that was? 

CASPER 
I don’t suppose, I know. It was because the U.S. Attorney blew it. 

SAM 
Twelve jurors say no and you’re still... 

CASPER 
The man was named by Joe McCarthy as part... 

SAM 
The "20 Years of Treason".

CASPER 
Yes. Which was called at the time, a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any 
previous venture in the history of man. 

SAM 
Somebody, wake me up from this ‘cause I think you just deputized Joe McCarthy into your 
argument. 

CASPER 
My point... 

SAM 
You know who else was on that list? 

CASPER 
Sam. 

SAM 
General George Marshall, author of the Marshall Plan and mentor to Eisenhower. Course that 
was after he won World War II. 

CASPER 
We made more than we missed. 

SAM 
Owen Lattimore, I.F. Stone. 

CASPER 
Not everybody at State was wrongly accused. 

SAM 
You guys rounded up some pretty dangerous TV comedy writers, too. 

CASPER 
Sam... 

SAM 
Ring Larder's just died. How many years does he get back? 

CASPER 
Listen to me. The Bureau’s had moments in its past that it’s not proud of. I’ll bet if we 
comb through the fine print of history we might be able to find one or two occupants of 
the Oval Office who could say the same thing. [Sam lowers his eyes.] But the difference is 
our failures are public and our successes are private. So when we apprehend an enemy of the 
state, like say, a fugitive member of West Virginia White Pride we don’t take a curtain 
call on Sunday with Sam and Cokie. When we learned that it wasn’t the Secret Service who 
ordered the canopy down in Rosslyn we kept it to ourselves. 

SAM 
Please, God, Mike. Please tell me you weren’t just threatening Toby Ziegler. 

CASPER 
I wasn’t, Sam. 

SAM 
Good. 

CASPER 
Yeah. 

SAM 
Anyway... "Because the Bureau will be embarrassed" isn’t a good enough reason. I’m putting 
Daniel Gault on the list. I just wanted to give you a heads-up. 

CASPER 
Anything else? 

SAM 
Nope. 

Sam exits. Casper picks up the phone and starts dialing.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY
People are standing near the podium with an AV display. C.J. enters, passes a sign that 
reads "Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality." 

C.J. 
Hi. I’m sorry. 

DR. JOHN FALLOW 
Hello. 

C.J. 
I’m sorry to be late. 

FALLOW 
Not a problem. 

C.J. 
I’m C.J. Cregg. 

FALLOW 
Of course you are. I’m Dr. John Fallow. This is Dr. Cynthia Sayles and Professor Donald Huke. 

C.J. 
Huke? 

DONALD HUKE 
Huke. 

C.J. 
Okay. And you are the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality. 

FALLOW 
Well, we’re from the OCSE. We have many members. 

C.J. 
How many? 

FALLOW 
4300 dues-paying members. 

C.J. 
What are the dues? 

FALLOW 
$20 a year for the newsletter. 

C.J. 
Let’s start. 

Josh enters from the back of room. 

JOSH 
Wait. Wait, I want to see this. 

C.J. 
This is Josh Lyman. 

FALLOW 
Indeed you are. 

C.J. 
Josh, this is Dr. Fallow... 

JOSH 
Hi. 

C.J. 
...and his merry men. 

The cartographers laugh politely. 

FALLOW 
Yes. 

C.J. 
Should we begin? 

FALLOW 
Yes. 

C.J. and Josh sit down. 

FALLOW 
Plain and simple, we’d like President Bartlet to aggressively support legislation that 
would make it mandatory for every public school in America to teach geography using the 
Peters Projection Map instead of the traditional Mercator. 

JOSH 
Give me 200 bucks and it’s done. 

HUKE 
Really? 

C.J. 
No. Why are we changing maps? 

DR. CYNTHIA SAYLES 
Because, C.J., the Mercator Projection has fostered European imperialist attitudes for 
centuries and created an ethnic bias against a Third World. 

C.J. 
Really? 

Fallow brings the map up on the projector. 

FALLOW 
The German cartographer, Mercator, originally designed this map in 1569 as a navigational 
tool for European sailors. 

HUKE 
The map enlarges areas at the poles to create straight lines of constant bearing or 
geographic direction. 

CYNTHIA SAYLES 
So, it makes it easier to cross an ocean. 

FALLOW 
But... 

C.J. 
Yes? 

FALLOW 
It distorts the relative size of nations and continents. 

C.J. 
Are you saying the map is wrong? 

FALLOW 
Oh, dear, yes. Uh, look at Greenland. 

C.J. 
Okay... 

FALLOW 
Now look at Africa. 

C.J. 
Okay... 

FALLOW 
The two landmasses appear to be roughly the same size. 

C.J. 
Yes. 

FALLOW 
Would it blow your mind if I told you that Africa is in reality fourteen times larger? 

Josh nudges C.J. with his knee, C.J. pushes him back. 

C.J. 
Yes. 

SAYLES 
Here we have Europe drawn considerably larger than South America when at 6.9 million 
square miles South America is almost double the size of Europe’s 3.8 million. 

HUKE 
Alaska appears three times as large as Mexico, when Mexico is larger by .1 million 
square miles. 

SAYLES 
Germany appears in the middle of the map when it’s in the northernmost quarter of the Earth. 

JOSH 
Wait, wait. Relative size is one thing, but you’re telling me that Germany isn’t where we 
think it is? 

FALLOW 
Nothing’s where you think it is. 

C.J. 
Where is it? 

FALLOW 
I’m glad you asked. [brings up a new map, which has its continents significally squished 
northward] The Peters Projection. 

C.J. and Josh lean forward. 

SAYLES 
It has fidelity of axis. 

HUKE 
Fidelity of position. 

SAYLES 
East-west lines are parallel and intersect north-south axes at right angles. 

C.J. 
What the hell is that? 

FALLOW 
It’s where you’ve been living this whole time. Should we continue? 

JOSH 
Uh-huh. 

CUT TO: INT. WORLD POLICY AUDITORIUM - DAY
The crowd is still yelling. Toby and Rhonda are at a table on stage. 

WEBBER 
[to protesters] Look, I’m not saying that we’re going to like their answers. I’m saying 
we’re going to give him a chance to talk. Now if you do have a question... 

PROTESTER 4 
Yeah, my question is who elected his boss the people or Kaiser-Permanente? 

PROTESTER 5 
He’s not my President, let’s vote. 

PROTESTER 6 
Who do you really work for? 

More yelling. 

SACHS 
[to Toby] You’re having a pretty good time, aren’t you? 

TOBY 
Well, it’s not like being at a Yankee game. 

PROTESTER 7 
You suck! 

TOBY 
Well, actually... [chuckles] Yeah, it’s like being at a Yankee game. 

SACHS 
So, Toby? 

TOBY 
Officer? 

SACHS 
Since you’re not really doing anything right now, I was wondering, what’s this all about? 

TOBY 
It’s about the WTO, Rhonda, the World Trade Organization. 

SACHS 
Well, I get that from the signs and the newspapers. 

TOBY 
The World Trade Organization’s a group of 140 countries who have agreed to specific trade 
policies. 

SACHS 
So, what’s wrong with that? 

TOBY 
Nothing’s wrong with that. 

SACHS 
What would they say if I asked them the same question? 

TOBY 
They’d say the WTO benefits corporations and not people. 

SACHS 
Does it? 

TOBY 
Benefits both. [pause] Look at them. 

SACHS 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Philistines. 

SACHS 
Take my nightstick and go kick their ass. 

TOBY 
Yeah, make all the jokes you want but let me tell you something they claim to speak for 
the underprivileged but here in the blackest city in America, I’m looking at a room with 
no black faces. No Asians, No Hispanics. Where the hell’s the Third World they claim to 
represent? 

SACHS 
Lot of Third-Worlders in the Cabinet Room today, were there? 

TOBY 
You’re starting to bother me. 

SACHS 
That’s ‘cause I’m armed. 

TOBY 
No, I like that. [pause] I’m going outside. 

The crowd continues yelling.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Sam enters, followed by Charlie. They walk.

CHARLIE 
Hey, Sam. 

SAM 
Hey, Charlie, what’s going on? 

CHARLIE 
The President lost his first choice of a site for the library. 

SAM 
What happened? 

CHARLIE 
There’s an 18th century farmhouse they can’t take down. 

SAM 
They’ll find another site. 

CHARLIE 
Yeah, anyway, he’s kind of in a mood. 

SAM 
They shouldn’t be talking to him now about the library, anyway. We’re not going anywhere 
for a few years, right? 

CHARLIE 
Well, I think that’s what’s got him in a mood. 

SAM 
Yeah. 

Charlie continues walking, Sam breaks off and enters the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. 

GINGER 
Sam, you just got a call. 

SAM 
Ginger, do me a favor and catch the calls. I’m going to lie down in Toby’s office for a 
few minutes. 

GINGER 
Sam, it was the National Security Advisor. 

Sam takes note.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Nancy McNally is alone, talking on the phone at the table. 

NANCY 
Well, he’s talking about force protection, right? I’m sorry, Colonel, that was me. He’s 
talking about force protection? Right, but the President’s going to ask me about the 
readiness issue. 

The door opens, Sam enters, and Nancy waves him over to the table. 

NANCY 
I’m saying he’s going to want to distinguish readiness and force protection. No, that 
was me again. [to Sam with hand over receiver] I’m the only woman on a conference call. 
Delaney can’t tell when it’s me talking. Do I have a bizarrely androgynous voice? 

Sam shrugs and sits down. 

NANCY 
[into phone] Excuse me, I’m going to step off for just a minute. 

Nancy hangs up phone, Sam sighs.

NANCY
How you doing? 

SAM 
Good. 

NANCY 
Good. Drop Daniel Gault. 

SAM 
Nancy... 

NANCY 
Drop Daniel Gault, do it right now. 

SAM 
Why? 

NANCY 
‘Cause I just told you to. 

SAM 
Nancy, I’m a lawyer. Let’s let reason and logic have its moment. There was one witness. 

NANCY 
Sam... 

SAM 
Earl Lydecker, a low level State Department staffer who confessed to FBI counterintelligence 
officers that he and Gault had conspired to send U.S. economic analysis documents to Soviet 
agents at the Russian embassy. 

NANCY 
Yes. 

SAM 
He confessed, by the way, for no particular reason. 

NANCY 
Yes. 

SAM 
It was subsequently demonstrated that Lydecker was a clinically diagnosed manic-depressive 
with a history of... wait for it... institutionalization. This was the chief witness for 
the prosecution. According to... 

NANCY 
Sam... 

SAM 
Excuse me, please. According to retired KGB Colonel Oleg Prosorov a search of the files 
at Lubyanka reveals only one reference to Gault. That he was approached in 1943 and 
labeled "highly uncooperative" and a "poor prospect for recruitment". 

NANCY 
Sam, Daniel Gault was a spy. 

SAM 
[incredulously] Oh my God... 

NANCY 
He was a Soviet spy, Sam. 

SAM 
Based on what? 

NANCY 
Diplomatic cables intercepted by U.S. Army Signal Intelligence in the 1940s. 

SAM 
If that was the case, why couldn’t the U.S. Attorney make espionage in the 1950s? 

NANCY 
‘Cause the cables weren’t decrypted until the 1970s. 

SAM 
You’re telling me that we cracked some obscure Russian code and suddenly we learned Gault 
was a spy? 

NANCY 
Yes. 

SAM 
That’s crap. If the FBI had proof on Gault they would have told the world about it. 

NANCY 
No they wouldn’t have, Sam. 

SAM 
Nancy... 

NANCY 
No they wouldn’t have, neither would the NSA, neither would Central Intelligence. You don’t 
show someone you’ve broken their ciphers unless you have to. Gault was long dead. But before 
he was, he was an agent called "Black Water". He was a delegate at Yalta. And he returned 
to the U.S. by way of Rostov where he was awarded the Order of Lenin. 

SAM 
Yeah, well, I’ll believe that when they show me the file. 

Nancy reaches behind her, picks up a heavy file and places it in front of Sam.

SAM
That’s not an FBI file. 

NANCY 
It’s an NSA file. 

SAM 
Nancy, I’m classified but I don’t have code word clearance. 

NANCY 
I know. 

SAM 
I’m saying I’m not allowed to see that and you could get into trouble for showing it to me. 

NANCY 
I could go to jail for showing it to you, which obviously I’m not going to do. [opens the 
file] I have blacked out any lateral reference that is code word classified. Those are the 
only things I’ve blacked out and they are in no way relevant to your question. Look at me. 
Do you believe me? 

SAM 
[softly] Of course. 

NANCY 
Go ahead.

Sam starts reading. Nancy picks up the phone again. 

NANCY 
This is Dr. Nancy McNally, the National Security Advisor. But again, that’s force 
protection and not readiness....

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR 

FADE IN: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY
The camera pans from the OCSE group to C.J., standing. 

FALLOW 
So, uh... You’re probably wondering what all this has to do with social equality? 

C.J. 
No. I’m wondering where France really is. 

Josh joins C.J., standing. 

JOSH 
Guys, we want to thank you very much for coming in... 

C.J. 
Hang on. We’re going to finish this. 

JOSH 
Okay.

HUKE 
What do maps have to do with social equality, you ask? 

JOSH 
She asked.

HUKE 
Salvatore Natoli of the National Council for Social Studies argues "In our society we 
unconsciously equate size with importance, and even power". 

Josh and C.J. exchange looks. 

JOSH 
I’m going to check in on Toby. 

C.J. 
Go. 

JOSH 
[to C.J.] These guys find Brigadoon on that map you’ll call me, right? 

C.J. 
Probably not. 

JOSH 
Okay. [exits] 

FALLOW 
When Third World countries are misrepresented they’re likely to be valued less. When 
Mercator maps exaggerate the importance of Western civilization, when the top of the map 
is given to the northern hemisphere and the bottom is given to the southern... then people 
will tend to adopt top and bottom attitudes. 

C.J. 
But... wait. How... Where else could you put the Northern Hemisphere but on the top? 

SAYLES 
On the bottom. 

C.J. 
How? 

FALLOW 
Like this. 

The map is flipped over. 

C.J. 
Yeah, but you can’t do that. 

FALLOW 
Why not? 

C.J. 
‘Cause it’s freaking me out. 

CUT TO: INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - DAY
The protesters are shouting. 

TOBY 
It’s activist vacation is what it is. Spring break for anarchist wannabes. The black 
t-shirts, the gas masks as fashion accessories. 

SACHS 
These kids today, with the hair and the clothes... 

TOBY 
All right, that’s it, flatfoot. 

SACHS 
I got great feet. 

TOBY 
You want the benefits of free trade? Food is cheaper. 

SACHS 
Yes. 

TOBY 
Food is cheaper, clothes are cheaper, steel is cheaper, cars are cheaper, phone service 
is cheaper. You feel me building a rhythm here? That’s ‘cause I’m a speechwriter and I 
know how to make a point. 

SACHS 
Toby... 

TOBY 
It lowers prices, it raises income. You see what I did with ‘lowers’ and ‘raises’ there? 

SACHS 
Yes. 

TOBY 
It’s called the science of listener attention. We did repetition, we did floating opposites 
and now you end with the one that’s not like the others. Ready? Free trade stops wars. And 
that’s it. Free trade stops wars! And we figure out a way to fix the rest! One world, one 
peace. I’m sure I’ve seen that on a sign somewhere. 

SACHS 
God, Toby... Wouldn’t it be great if there was someone around here with communication skills 
who could go in there and tell them that? 

TOBY 
Shut up. 

Josh enters through the police line. 

JOSH 
Toby... 

TOBY 
What are you doing here? 

JOSH 
Came down to see how it was going. [to Sachs] How’s it going? Josh Lyman. 

SACHS 
Rhonda Sachs. 

JOSH 
Any trouble? 

SACHS 
No. 

TOBY 
[raises his hand] Josh. The WTO is undemocratic, and accountable to no one, decisions 
are made by Executive Directors and the developing world has little to say about 
institutional policy. 

JOSH 
What was that? 

TOBY 
I protested to you. 

JOSH 
Why? 

TOBY 
‘Cause I’m not allowed to get arrested anymore. 

JOSH 
Let’s go back. 

TOBY 
No, I hate these people with the heat of a nova. Yet here I go. 

SACHS 
Attaboy. 

TOBY 
Shut up. 

SACHS 
I got your back, man, you know? Or not. 

All three enter the building.

BARTLET 
Charlie?

CHARLIE 
[enters] Yes, sir? 

BARTLET 
Let’s do calls in the residence, okay? 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
I think there were a couple of late memos.

LEO 
[enters] Good evening, Mr. President. 

CHARLIE 
They’re on your desk, sir. 

BARTLET 
Thanks. 

Charlie exits. 

BARTLET 
I’m going to head home. 

LEO 
At 7:30? 

BARTLET 
I’ll make calls from the residence. 

LEO 
Are you feeling all right? 

BARTLET 
Yeah. 

LEO 
I heard you lost the site. What’s the backup? 

BARTLET 
Well, there’s this wooded land on the Connecticut River, but the Abenaki Indians are 
claiming it’s an ancient burial ground. 

LEO 
Ah. 

BARTLET 
There’s a magnificent bluff overlooking an orchard in Orford and the owner is willing, 
if not eager, to donate the land. 

LEO 
What’s the problem? 

BARTLET 
The owner’s doing 40 months at Allenwood for securities fraud. 

LEO 
You’ll find a site. 

BARTLET 
This is how long I get before I have to start with the library? Two years? And the first 
six months was figuring out how to work the phones? Oh, by the way, they’ve changed the 
phones again. 

LEO 
Yeah. 

BARTLET 
This is the last job I’ve ever going to have. This is the last time I’m going to come to 
work with people. I swear to God, I feel like I was just starting to get good at it. 

LEO 
Well, it’s two years, with an option for four more.

Bartlet doesn’t respond.

LEO
Mr. President, is there anything we need to talk about? 

BARTLET 
Not yet, okay? 

LEO 
Okay. 

BARTLET 
I’ll see you tomorrow. 

LEO 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Bartlet exits.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Sam is tossing sugar packets into a metal pot. Sugar packets clang as they hit the pot. 
Donna enters. 

DONNA 
Sam? What are you doing? 

SAM 
I don’t know. 

DONNA 
Where’ve you been all afternoon? 

SAM 
Been around. Then I came down here to practice my sugar tossing, ‘cause if you don’t 
practice, then you might as well give the clarinet to a kid who’ll use it. 

DONNA 
Stephanie’s upstairs. I put her in your office ‘cause Josh is back. 

SAM 
When she said that from what she’s heard I’m the one to talk to, that... I have the ear 
of the President, you told her to say that, right? 

DONNA 
It was... This was so important to her. I... [chuckles nervously] I wanted to give... 
Yes. I did. I’m sorry. I didn’t... 

SAM 
I don’t know why you’d think I was like that. I mean, for fun, but... I don’t know why 
you’d think I was like that. 

DONNA 
It was wrong. 

SAM 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
Were you able to...?

SAM 
He was a spy. 

DONNA 
You’re sure? 

SAM 
Yes. 

DONNA 
No. I mean it’s not possible that he... 

SAM 
His code name was "Black Water". He copied by hand State Department and White House 
documents and delivered them to the Soviets. They included... 

DONNA 
Sam... 

SAM 
...Roosevelt’s plans to enter the war... 

DONNA 
You can’t tell her. You have to tell her something else. 

SAM 
Possible recruitment targets. 

DONNA 
Sam, it was... 

SAM 
Lists of Communists and Communist sympathizers in the State Department and National 
Recovery Administration. 

DONNA 
Sam... 

SAM 
What are you, out of your mind? I’m telling her right now. 

Sam starts to walk out, Donna chases after him. 

DONNA 
No. No, Sam. Please, you really can’t do this. 

SAM 
Secret memoranda on the U.S. negotiating stance at Yalta... 

DONNA 
Please stop walking. 

Both start climbing the STAIRS. 

SAM 
Good, ‘cause Stalin needed an advantage and we wanted a fair fight. 

DONNA 
Sam, nothing good comes from telling her. 

SAM 
The truth isn’t good? 

DONNA 
Not right now, no. The father is not going to live another three months... let it go 
till then. 

SAM 
I’m not her fairy godmother. She asked me to look into this. 

DONNA 
I’m saying, you wait three months until... 

SAM 
Hey. 

DONNA 
You’re in a bad... 

SAM 
Donna... 

DONNA 
Listen to me. You’re in a bad place right now and you shouldn’t make this decision. If 
you don’t tell her tonight, you can tell her tomorrow. If you tell her tonight, that’s it. 

SAM 
Donna. 

DONNA 
It was people pushing paper around fifty years ago. Why does it matter? 

Both stop on the STAIRS. 

SAM 
It was high treason, and it mattered a great deal! This country is an idea, and one that’s 
lit the world for two centuries and treason against that idea is not just a crime against 
the living! This ground holds the graves of people who died for it, who gave what Lincoln 
called the last full measure of devotion. Of fidelity. You understand the last full measure 
of devotion to... Treason against them is... [almost crying] 

DONNA 
[softly] Sam... 

SAM 
There was a translator in the Hungarian trade mission named Shaba Demsky. She was murdered 
in 1952. She was about to reveal the name of a Soviet agent called Black Water. This girl’s 
going to find out who her father was.

He continues to climb stairs. 

DONNA 
Sam... [he turns] You meant grandfather. 

Sam turns around and continues down the hall.

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Sam enters his office. Stephanie stands as he comes through the door. 

STEPHANIE 
Tell me there’s good news. 

SAM 
Have you ever heard of a woman named Shaba Demsky? 

STEPHANIE 
No. [pause] Sam? 

Sam looks past Stephanie to Donna as she stands just outside his door. 

SAM 
I’m sorry, Stephanie. I wasn’t able to get access to the people I needed, to have it 
considered this time around. Why don’t you tell your father you’ll be able to try again 
in three months. 

STEPHANIE 
So, you’re open to it? 

SAM 
Absolutely. 

STEPHANIE 
[relieved sigh] That’s all he needed. That’s all I needed.

Donna enters the office. 

STEPHANIE 
[to Donna] Did you hear? 

DONNA 
You should call him right now. 

STEPHANIE 
Can I use the phone on your desk? 

DONNA 
Yeah, dial 9. 

STEPHANIE 
Everyone was right about you, Sam. 

DONNA 
Sam’s the man.

Stephanie exits. Sam looks crestfallen, and Donna comes over and hugs him. 

SAM 
It’s just there are certain things you’re sure of... like longitude and latitude. 

DONNA 
Sam, I don’t know if this is the best time to tell you, but according to C.J., I wouldn’t 
be so sure about longitude and latitude. 

Sam chuckles, and releases from the hug. 

JOSH 
Hey... [enters] You should have seen Toby. 

SAM 
He was good? 

JOSH 
He blew the doors off the place. Then I almost got killed. 

DONNA and SAM 
How? 

JOSH 
I got hit with a piece of a banana. 

TOBY 
Let’s go. 

JOSH 
[to Toby] You know what you are? You are old school, my friend. 

TOBY 
Stop talking like that. Let’s go. 

JOSH 
Let me tell you something, though. That was the second time this year I almost got killed 
and both times I was with you so you’re going to need a new wingman. 

TOBY 
You were my old wingman? 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Let’s go. 

DONNA 
Where are you going? 

JOSH 
Toby and I are going to get Sam drunk, and then put him to bed. 

DONNA 
I’ll come. [leaves] 

TOBY 
Let’s go. 

SAM 
I’m going to meet you there. 

JOSH 
Yeah? 

Sam nods.

JOSH
All right.

Sam closes the door behind Josh. Don Henley's "New York Minute" plays again.


	Lying here in the darkness 
	I hear the sirens wail 
	Somebody’s going to emergency 
	Somebody’s going to jail 


Sam takes the phone message out of pocket and starts dialing.


	If you find somebody to love in this world
	You better hang on tooth and nail 
	The wolf is always at the door.


SAM
