TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT - FRIDAY EVENING
We see the panel of Supreme Court Judges sitting on the bench. One of them is reading a 
verdict in front of three public defenders.

JUDGE
Assuming arguendo that the district court erred in allowing the jury to consider non-
statutory factors that were vague, overbroad or duplicative in violation of the eighth 
amendment such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The application for a stay 
of execution of the sentence of death, presented to the Chief Justice and referred by him 
to the court, is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorary is denied. The petitioner 
is remanded to the federal facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, to be executed by lethal 
injection, Monday morning at 12:01 a.m.

At the sound of the gavel, we--

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
The three public defenders are walking down the hall.

P.D. 1
Who’s our guy at the White House?

JERRY
It’s over.

P.D. 1
Jerry...

JERRY
It’s over.

P.D. 1
Who’s our guy at the White House?

JERRY
We don’t have a guy at the White House.

P.D. 1
I’m saying who can we call right now?

JERRY
At eight o’clock on a Friday?

P.D. 1
Yes.

JERRY
The switchboard operator.

P.D. 1
Jerry, who do we know who’s got the ear of the President?

JERRY
Nobody!

BOBBY
Sam Seaborn. [They all stop walking.]

JERRY
You know Seaborn?

BOBBY
I used to beat him up in high school.

JERRY
You’re kidding me.

BOBBY
No.

P.D. 1
You can call him right now?

BOBBY
Yeah.

P.D. 1
He’ll take the call?

BOBBY
Let’s find out.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Josh had just finished work and is about to leave. He tries to tell Donna that he’s going 
to go.

JOSH
I’m out of here.

DONNA
You’ve got to see Sam.

Josh turns back and walks the other way. Donna joins him into the HALLWAY.

JOSH
I’m seeing Sam, and then I’m out of here.

DONNA
Are you going to behave yourself tonight?

JOSH
It’s a bachelor party.

DONNA
I’m saying...

JOSH
I can hold my liquor.

DONNA
No you can’t.

JOSH
I can drink with the best of them.

DONNA
You can’t drink with any of them, Josh.

JOSH
I’m in politics, okay. I can drink.

DONNA
You have a very sensitive system.

JOSH
I wish you’d stop telling people that. It makes me sound like an idiot.

DONNA
You’re gonna have two drinks and spend the rest of the weekend sleeping it off.

JOSH
And this is the first time in a long time I’ve had the opportunity to spend the weekend 
doing anything but working, is my point.

DONNA
Are there going to be strippers?

JOSH
Nah.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Tell me the truth.

JOSH
There aren’t going to be strippers there. Men don’t like that anymore.

DONNA
Men don’t like naked women anymore?

JOSH
No, we still like naked women a lot. It’s looking at them in a room full of your best 
friends that makes you feel a little...

DONNA
Sleazy?

JOSH
Uncomfortable.

Josh walks up to Sam as he comes out of the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Donna walks away.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
Hi.

JOSH
I’m out of here. What do you need? [They start walking.]

SAM
[calls to office in general] What do I need?

BONNIE
O’Dwyer.

SAM
Yes. I need you to do me a favor.

JOSH
On O’Dwyer?

SAM
His people are calling. They want to know what’s going on.

JOSH
Who’s his people?

SAM
A campaign manager. A guy named Joey Lucas.

JOSH
Never heard of him.

SAM
Me neither.

JOSH
What’s he like?

SAM
I didn’t speak with him. I spoke with his assistant. 

JOSH
What’s the favor?

SAM
I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow with him to try to figure out what’s going on.

JOSH
Aren’t you going sailing tomorrow?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Then how are you gonna... [light dawns] Oh, come on!

SAM
Ten minutes.

They had gone back to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

JOSH
On a Saturday!

SAM
Well, do you have plans?

JOSH
I was planning on doing nothing.

SAM
Ten minutes, fifteen minutes tops.

JOSH
Sam...

SAM
He’s going to be very excited to meet with you. Joshua Lyman, Deputy Chief of Staff. 
He can hear it from the horse’s mouth.

JOSH
What am I supposed to tell him?

SAM
On O’Dwyer?

JOSH
Yeah.

Donna walks up.

SAM
Tell him the truth.

JOSH
I don’t think so. What else you got?

DONNA
What time?

SAM
10:00 tomorrow morning.

DONNA
[to Josh] You have to be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

JOSH
We have to be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

DONNA
Why me?

JOSH
‘Cause you work for me.

DONNA
[pouts] I have things to do tomorrow morning, Josh. It was my Saturday too.

JOSH
What things?

DONNA
I have to go shopping.

JOSH
For what?

DONNA
Whatever! It’s Saturday.

JOSH
Ten minutes. When it’s over I’ll buy you some shoes. 

DONNA
[smiles] Really? [leaves]

JOSH
I’m out of here.

SAM
I’m bringing back the Cup, man.

JOSH
Sam, just stay in the boat this time and I’m a happy guy.

SAM
Okay.

JOSH
Good luck. [walks off]

SAM
[shouting after Josh] I’ve got foul weather gear.

JOSH
[shouts back] See you later.

Bonnie is getting ready to leave. So is Sam. They start to put on their jackets.

SAM
Bonnie, I’m done?

BONNIE
You’re done.

SAM
I’m cutting the cord, Bonnie. I’m gonna be unreachable for the weekend.

BONNIE
Good.

SAM
Not taking my pager. [puts it on desk] Not taking my cell phone. [puts it next to pager]

BONNIE
You’ve earned it!

SAM
Out on the ocean blue. Totally cut off from the White House.

BONNIE
It’ll be good for you.

SAM
[to himself] I’m taking my pager. [sticks it in his coat pocket] Should probably take my 
cell phone too. [picks it up] No. No. Cutting the cord. [puts it down] Not taking the cell 
phone. [pulls pager out and puts it on desk] Not taking the pager.

BONNIE
Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

BONNIE
You need to relax.

SAM
Yeah.

BONNIE
Have a good weekend.

SAM
You too.

Bonnie leaves. The phone rings as Sam is leaving. He looks at it, then shuts off the 
light and closes the door behind him. The phone rings some more before Sam comes back 
in and picks it up. 

SAM
Sam Seaborn.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. COURTHOUSE - NIGHT
Sam and BOBBY ZANE, one of the public defenders, are walking through.

SAM
Is he guilty?

BOBBY
That’s not the point.

SAM
Is he guilty?

BOBBY
Sam.

SAM
Bobby, is he guilty?

BOBBY
In ‘94 Justice Blackmun officially went on record...

SAM
Bobby!

BOBBY
It was a drug cartel. He killed two kingpins.

SAM
You want me to argue it was a public service measure? 

BOBBY
Sam, I’m not talking about a couple of schoolgirls.
 
SAM
Blackmun’s in support of the death penalty.

BOBBY
I tell you he reversed himself in ‘94. “From this day forward,” he said, “I no longer 
shall tinker with the machinery of death.”

SAM
Yes.

BOBBY
“I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty 
experiment has failed.”

SAM
You don’t have to quote Harry Blackmun with me.

BOBBY
You are going to go to the President, and you’re gonna tell him he can’t run from this 
one. He’s got to consider my client. You’re gonna tell him that.

SAM
I don’t talk to the President that way, Bobby. Nobody talks to the President that way. 
And I’m gonna tell you not that many people talk to me that way anymore.

BOBBY
I’ve got a guy 48 hours away from death. You’re gonna make this personal?

SAM
How long you been with the P.D.’s office?

BOBBY
About two years.

SAM
I heard you were at Ross-Lipton.

BOBBY
Yeah, I was.

SAM
What happened?

BOBBY
They gave me a partnership and a corner office, Sam. What do you think happened?

SAM
The President’s very serious about the separation of powers.

BOBBY
Yeah, but so’s the Constitution. In Article 2, Section 2 says, “He shall have the power 
to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.”

SAM
Thanks for pointing that out. I’m saying the judicial branch has spoken, so why should...?

BOBBY
Oh, that’s what he’s going to hide behind?

SAM
The President’s not hiding behind anything. Right now the President’s on Air Force One 
coming back home from Stockholm. 

BOBBY
So when does he land?

SAM
Around 9:00 a.m.

BOBBY
That’s when you’re going to talk to him?

SAM
Well, I won’t be here tomorrow morning, but I’ll ask Toby Ziegler to talk...

BOBBY
Where are you going?

SAM
Bobby.

BOBBY
Sam.

SAM
I’ll pass it up to Toby Ziegler. He’ll ask for a few minutes of the President’s time, 
but I have to be honest with you. After a long trip...

BOBBY
He’ll talk to the President first thing in the morning?

SAM
Well, it’s Saturday. I think Toby will probably be at temple first thing in the morning.

BOBBY
What temple?

SAM
Bobby.

BOBBY
What temple?

SAM
I don’t know the name of the temple.

BOBBY
You know where it is?

SAM
[caught off guard] I think it’s on Delaware.

BOBBY
Thank you. 

Sam is a little surprised after Bobby quickly walks away.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam returns to his office to grab his bag.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Leo comes out of the Roosevelt Room. Sam sees him behind. They walk together.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
I thought you left.

SAM
I just came back to get my bag.

LEO
What’s going on?

SAM
They denied the appeal.

LEO
Simon Cruz.

SAM
Yeah.

LEO
I thought they were sending it back to the...

SAM
Me too.

LEO
No, our guy said they were going to send it back to the sixth circuit.

SAM
Well they didn’t. The denied the appeal five-three.
 
LEO
That’s not what was supposed to happen.

SAM
We’ve got the get Mendoza on the Bench.

LEO
Come on.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
If Mendoza was on the bench, they would have lost five-four. So what are we talking about?

SAM
The execution is scheduled...

LEO
What? 

They reach LEO’S OFFICE.

SAM
The execution is scheduled for 12:01 Monday morning, so the ball’s in our court.

LEO
I’m not sure the President wants the ball in our court. 

SAM
Well, that makes two of us.

LEO
Have a good weekend.

SAM
You’re not gonna...

LEO
He lands at 9:00 tomorrow morning. I’ll let him sleep a little bit then I’ll talk it 
through with him.

SAM
I can brief Toby before I leave.

LEO
Right.

SAM
I’ll see you later. [starts to leave]

LEO
Sam.

SAM
Yeah? [turns back]

LEO
Why Monday morning?

SAM
What do you mean?

LEO
The court denied the appeal. Why isn’t he being executed at midnight tonight?

SAM
We don’t execute people between sundown Friday and sundown Sunday.

LEO
Why?

SAM
Hard as it is to believe...

LEO
[figures it out for himself] You’re kidding me.
 
SAM
No.

LEO
We don’t execute people on the Sabbath.

SAM
No.

LEO
Well, that’s about the most bizarre thing I’ve ever heard.

SAM
Leo, I think you’re gonna find as you go through this weekend that there’s virtually no 
part of this discussion that isn’t bizarre. I’m gonna go home now. I got to race in the 
morning. [leaves]

LEO
[calls after Sam] Hold on to a rope or something, would you.

SAM
Yeah.

Sam leaves. The camera closes on Leo.

LEO
Damn it.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - NIGHT
Sam goes to sign out. He picks up the pen and thinks. He changes his mind and heads back.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam sets down his bag, pulls a book off the shelf and sits down at his desk. He turns on 
the light, puts on his glasses and starts reading.

FADE TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
SATURDAY, 9:00 A.M.
Donna arrives. She puts down her bag and hangs her jacket. She opens the door to JOSH’S 
OFFICE. She finds Josh lying on the floor in front of his desk in disgustingly dirty 
clothes, snoring.

DONNA
Josh. 

Josh snores. 

DONNA
Josh!

Josh, sputtering, wakes up and sits up, blinking. He is very obviously hung over, and 
has a pair of lacy red panties around his neck.

JOSH
Hi.

DONNA
What are you doing?

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Did you spend the night here?

JOSH
No. Just since a couple of hours ago.

DONNA
The party went to morning?

JOSH
Yup.

DONNA
Why didn’t you go home?

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Why didn’t you go home after the party?

JOSH
I couldn’t find my keys, or remember where I lived. [pulls the panties off over his head]

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
I think there might have been strippers there. [gets up]

DONNA
[yells] Oh my God! 

Josh shushes her. 

DONNA
What happened to your clothes?

JOSH
I may have wrinkled my suit.

DONNA
Josh!

JOSH
Donna. You... You really want to speak very softly.

DONNA
How did you get like this?

JOSH
People were pouring champagne over each other.

DONNA
And then wrestling in dirt?

JOSH
I can’t remember, but it’s certainly not out of the question.

DONNA
You have a meeting.

JOSH
Yeah, I know. I’m not, you know. Uh... what was the meeting again?

DONNA
Joey Lucas about O’Dwyer.

JOSH
Yes. [puts on his suit jacket.]

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
I’m fine.

DONNA
You can’t wear those clothes. [holds her nose]
 
JOSH
I’m fine.

DONNA
Trust me.

JOSH
They’re the only clothes I got.

DONNA
I’ll find some other clothes.

JOSH
Fine. [sits in his chair as Donna starts to leave]

DONNA
Are you going to listen to me from now on? 

JOSH
[under breath] I’m not even listening to you now.

DONNA
[shouts] I said, are you going to listen...

JOSH
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Donna leaves and Josh slumps forward onto his desk.

CUT TO: EXT. ANDREW'S AIR FORCE BASE - DAY
Leo gets out of a limousine. He walks toward Bartlet, C.J. and Charlie as they come off 
of Air Force One.

BARTLET
C.J., look...

C.J.
Don’t start with me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I was helping pass the time. I was being entertaining as well as instructive.

C.J.
I’m back in America now, I have rights. I’m no longer belted down next to the passenger 
from hell.

LEO
[walks up] Welcome back, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Leo! What’re you doing here?

LEO
I needed a minute, sir. How was the flight?

C.J.
It was --

BARTLET
Great!

C.J.
-- gruesome. “If you’ll look out the left side of the cabin, you’ll see the fjords.” 
Then we got a history of the fjords. Then we got a quiz on the fjords. 
[to Bartlet] Do you have any idea how much I would like to dress you up in lederhosen 
and drop kick you into the fjords right now?

BARTLET
Aww. You don’t know how to have fun when we’re traveling...

C.J. and Bartlet get into the car.

CHARLIE
[quietly to Leo] It was quite a trip. [gets into car]

LEO
[under breath] It ain’t over yet.

He gets into the limousine. C.J. sneezes as they drive off.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Donna walks into Josh's office with bright yellow hip-waders in one hand and a cup in 
the other.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Huh.

DONNA
Here. [puts foul weather gear on desk]

JOSH
What’s that?

DONNA
It’s Sam’s foul weather gear. Drink this. [puts cup on desk]

JOSH
Coffee?

DONNA
It’s strong. Drink it all. 

Donna walks out. Josh drinks, gags, and lets the coffee run out of his mouth down the 
front of his shirt.

JOSH
Blah.

DONNA
[comes back in] It’s from yesterday, so it might not be hot anymore.

JOSH
What time is this person coming?

DONNA
Forty minutes. Put this on. [indicates hip-waders]

JOSH
I’m not wearing that.

DONNA
There’s a one-hour cleaners on Connecticut.

JOSH
He’s getting here in forty minutes.

DONNA
Zuzu will do it in half an hour.

JOSH
Who’s Zuzu?

DONNA
The guy from the dry cleaners, Josh. Change your clothes!

JOSH
His name is Zuzu?

DONNA
Change your clothes.

JOSH
I’ll look like the Gorton’s fisherman in this thing. [gets up and starts to change]

CUT TO: INT. JEWISH SYNAGOGUE - DAY
People sit down as the rabbi starts his sermon. We see Toby in the crowd.

RABBI
With Passover on the horizon, millions of Jews will gather round Seder tables, will sing 
our songs and ask our questions. 

Toby's beeper suddenly goes off. People look at him.

RABBI [cont.]
About the stick that beat the dog that bit the cat that ate the kid. 

Toby checks his beeper, then gets up and works his way out of the row and walks to the 
back while the rabbi continues.

RABBI [cont.]
We’ll sing not only to entertain our children but to be reminded by the Haggadah, the 
simple truth. That violence begets violence. Vengeance is not Jewish. We’ll pour ten 
drops...

CUT TO: INT. SYNAGOGUE ENTRANCEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Toby gets to the entranceway and pulls out his cell phone, dials. 

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
The phone rings and Sam answers it.

SAM
Sam Seaborn.

TOBY
What do you want?

SAM  
How ya doing?

TOBY
Sam, I’m at temple right now.

SAM
Yeah, by any chance is your rabbi giving a sermon on capital punishment?

TOBY 
What?

SAM
Is your rabbi giving a sermon on capital punishment? 

Toby puts his cell phone to his shoulder and listens to the rabbi.

RABBI
No matter how deep our desire to witness the sufferings of our enemies, we are commanded 
to relocate our humanity. Vengeance is not Jewish. We are commanded to relocate...

TOBY
[puts the phone back to his ear] Yeah, he is. How did you know that?

SAM
I’ll explain it to you when you get over here.

TOBY 
Why am I coming over there?

SAM
The appeal was denied.

TOBY
All right, I’m on my way.

Toby puts his phone away. Just as we hear the rabbi say “quietly,” he leans slightly 
against a stack of folded metal chairs and then watches in horror as they slide to the 
floor in a horrendous crash.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
A man and a woman burst in, to find Josh in an undershirt and the hip-waders. JOEY LUCAS, 
a deaf campaign manager is signing and her assistant, KENNY THURMAN is translating.

JOEY [KENNY]
Are you the unmitigated jackass who has the DNC choking off funding for the O’Dwyer 
campaign in the California forty-sixth?

JOSH
[bleary] What is God’s name is happening right now?

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m Joey Lucas.

JOSH
[to Kenny] You’re Joey Lucas?

Kenny looks at Joey, then back at Josh.

JOEY [KENNY]
No, I’m Joey Lucas.

JOSH
Help me, ‘cause I... I don’t...

JOEY
[yells] You idiot. I’m. Joey. Lucas.

JOSH
Ah. [pause] Ah, okay. I’m Josh Lyman.

JOEY [KENNY]
I know who you are.

JOSH
You’re Joey Lucas.

JOEY [KENNY]
What were you expecting?

JOSH
A man.

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m a woman.

JOSH
You’re O’Dwyer’s campaign manager? 

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes, and I have three sources, two at the DNC... 

Josh stands up. 

JOEY
What the hell are you wearing?

JOSH
Me?

JOEY
Yes.

JOSH
[looks down at himself] I was... I uh... I... I spilt some things on my clothes. Tell 
you what, let’s... let’s just take a deep breath for a second while I try and remember, 
you know, where I am right now.

Josh walks around the desk, obviously to within smelling distance of Joey, who covers her 
nose.

JOEY [KENNY]
Are you drunk?

JOSH
I have a very delicate system.

JOEY [KENNY]
Okay, look, I’m totally serious about this. I’m trying to get a guy elected to Congress. 
It’s gonna be a very tight race and I want to know why the White House is screwing around 
with me.

DONNA
[comes to the door, holding Josh's suit] Excuse me.

JOSH
Thank God.

DONNA
What’s going on?

JOSH
[to Joey] This is my assistant, Donna Moss. Donna, Joey Lucas.

DONNA
[to Joey] Hi.

JOSH
I’m just going to go... I... I... I’m... I’m gonna go change my clothes. I’ll... I’ll be 
right back. 

Josh and Donna walk out to the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Took you long enough.

DONNA
I got stuck at Dupont Circle again.

JOSH
You have any idea how dumb I looked in there?

DONNA
So Joey Lucas is a woman.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
And she’s deaf.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Cool.

JOSH
Give me those. 

He takes the clothes and heads into a room while Donna stays outside.

DONNA
You need to go see Sam.

JOSH
What’s Sam doing here?

DONNA
He told me to tell you the appeal was denied.

JOSH
What are you talking about?

DONNA
All he said was “The appeal was denied.”

JOSH
[nickel drops] Oh, man. Make sure they’re going to be okay in there. This might take a 
few minutes.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Sam and Mandy are doing research. Toby is just standing there, looking at Sam.

TOBY
Are you saying my rabbi wrote a sermon just for me? 

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
How did he know what was going on here?

SAM
One of the public defenders, guy named Bobby Zane...

TOBY
One of the public defenders spoke to my rabbi?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
How did he know where I go to temple? How did he know I even go to temple?

JOSH
[comes in, tucking in his shirt] I thought they were sending it back to the sixth circuit.

TOBY
I thought so too.

JOSH
Where’s the President?

SAM
He’s in the residence.

JOSH
Are we getting a briefing from Justice?

SAM
He’ll be here in a minute.

JOSH
When’s the execution?

SAM
Sunday, 12:01.

MANDY
Monday, 12:01.

SAM
Minute after midnight tomorrow.

JOSH
Lethal injection?

SAM
Yeah.

MANDY
[looks at Josh in disgust] Josh, you sleep in a dumpster last night?

JOSH
Possibly. [to Sam] Hey, why aren’t you sailing right now?

SAM
I stayed.

MANDY
Is there any evidence that capital punishment serves as a deterrent?

SAM
Speculative evidence at best.

MANDY
What are the stats on federal executions and the President stepping in?

SAM
‘63 was the last execution.

MANDY
Who was the last President to commute the sentence? 

JOSH
Lincoln.

MANDY
Abraham?

JOSH
No, Bert Lincoln. Mandy, what are you-?

MANDY
I’m asking. I’m surprised.

JOSH
I don’t want a debate on the death penalty. Let’s get some stuff together and get ready
for the President.

MANDY
I’m gonna start working with C.J. [leaves] 

JOSH
I gotta get back to... [starts to leave] Oh... By the way, Sam. Joey Lucas is waiting 
for me in my office right now.

SAM
Well, what’s he like?

JOSH
Well, for a campaign manager, he’s got very nice legs.

SAM
He’s a woman?

JOSH
Yes. He is. He’s also deaf. And very pissed. Be right back. [leaves]

TOBY
[looking pissed] Sam.

SAM
You know there’s room to give the President some judicial cover if he wants to commute.

TOBY
Sam.

SAM
This guy was convicted of three murders by a Mexican court. Does that matter to us? 
During the penalty phase, the trial judge let the prosecutor introduce the evidence 
of the Mexican convictions.

TOBY
I know.

SAM
Well, the Mexican courts are ridiculous, Toby. That never should have...

TOBY
How did the public defender know I was at that temple?

SAM
I’m saying, this guy didn’t have the world’s greatest legal council.

TOBY
How did he know where I was going to be?

SAM
I told him.

TOBY
You told him.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Sam, what’re you doing giving out that kind of information-

SAM
I know. I don’t know. Right at that moment it seemed like what I should do.

TOBY
He’s not going to commute the sentence, Sam.

SAM
We don’t know what the President’s gonna do.

TOBY
It seemed like what you should do?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - DAY
Bartlet is dressing up. Leo is briefing him.

LEO
So, anyway, he was tried and found guilty four years ago in the district court in 
Michigan. And the sixth circuit turned down his appeal. The Supreme Court gave him 
a stay, heard the case, turned him down five-three.

BARTLET
We got to get Mendoza on the bench.

LEO
Well, that’s Monday’s problem. Your problem’s today. 

BARTLET
Why is it my problem at all?

LEO
As opposed to who?

BARTLET
The governor of Michigan.

LEO
Oh, you mean, why isn’t it a state crime.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
It was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney under the ‘88 drug kingpin law that was modified 
into the ‘94 omnibus crime bill. 

BARTLET
Which allows for the death penalty in certain drug related homicides.

LEO
Well, basically. The deputy AG’s office is putting together a briefing for you.

BARTLET
How long?

LEO
About an hour.

BARTLET
Okay, I’ll wait for that then.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I’m gonna want to see our people over the next few days.

LEO
Everyone’s here now or on their way.

BARTLET
I’m not going to be very good at this, Leo.

LEO
Well, you’ll be joining a pretty big club, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah. [calls] Charlie!

LEO
I’ll call you when the guys have put something together. 

BARTLET
Thank you.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

CHARLIE
[comes in] Yes sir.

BARTLET
Charlie, there’s a priest in Hanover. His name is Thomas Cavanaugh. He’s at the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary. I’d like to arrange to have him come down and spend some 
time with me this weekend. Very important that the White House not pay for this. This 
is my nickel.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And I’m gonna want to... [stops]

CHARLIE
I’m sorry, sir?

BARTLET
No. No, never mind. [pause] Yeah. I’m gonna want to talk to the Pope.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[gets up and walks over to Charlie] I’m gonna ask you a question. And this is one of 
those times that it’s okay to tell me I’ve stepped over the line, and I should shut 
my mouth, okay. 

CHARLIE
Okay.

BARTLET
What happened to the guy who shot your mother?

CHARLIE
They haven’t found him yet sir.

BARTLET
If they did, would you wanna see him executed? 

Charlie just looks at him. 

BARTLET
Killing a police officer’s a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And?

CHARLIE
I wouldn’t want to see him executed, Mr. President --

Bartlet nods.

CHARLIE
-- I’d wanna do it myself.

BARTLET
[looks thoughtful] Yeah.

CHARLIE
I’ll get the ball rolling on these arrangements. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is back in his meeting.

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m running a campaign against a Conservative Republican who’s held his seat for 
over thirty years. He opposed gay rights, abortion, gun control, and raising the 
minimum wage. And supports government sponsored prayer in the schools and amending 
the Bill of Rights to prohibit burning an American flag. Now for the first time in 
three decades, we have a chance to beat him. Why are you telling the DNC to cut 
down my funding?

JOSH
Because you have a chance to beat him.

JOEY [KENNY]
Excuse me?

JOSH
We’ve been watching your campaign. You’re doing way too well.

JOEY [KENNY]
Are you deranged?

JOSH
He’s a preposterous figure. We want to keep him right where he is.

JOEY [KENNY]
You mean you want to keep him on as a poster boy for the Radical Right?

JOSH
Joey, every time he comes out with one of his declarations about brown people crossing 
the border, the DNC slaps it into a direct mail campaign, and he’s good for two or 
three million dollars.

JOEY [KENNY]
I want to speak to the President.

JOSH
[laughs] No problem.

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m perfectly serious.

JOSH
The President doesn’t take meetings on this level. I don’t even take meetings on 
this level!

JOEY [KENNY]
What level is that?

JOSH
Joey. [walks to the door]

JOEY [KENNY]
You can be afraid of me, pal. I can create problems for you, you’ve never even heard of.

JOSH
I’m not hearing a lot of party loyalty from you here, Joey.

JOEY [KENNY]
Well, maybe if your head wasn’t so far up your...

JOSH
Hey!

JOEY
I want to speak to the President!

JOSH
[shouting] Hey, Lunatic Lady! Trust me when I tell you that there’s absolutely no way 
that you are going to see the President!

BARTLET
[walks up] Hey, Josh.

JOSH
Hello, Mr. President. Welcome back.

BARTLET
How are you?

JOSH
Well, I’d like this day to be over pretty bad.

BARTLET
Who are your friends?

JOSH
Uh, this is Joey Lucas.

BARTLET
[to Joey] How are you?

JOEY
Honored to meet you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

JOSH
[indicates Kenny] And this is Kenny... somebody.

BARTLET
Hi, Kenny.

KENNY
Thurman.

JOSH
We were just finishing up.

BARTLET
I was just wandering the halls and thinking.

JOSH
Why don’t you let me show these people off and, uh, I can wander the halls with you.

BARTLET
[to Joey] You ever seen the White House?

JOEY
No sir.

BARTLET
Let’s take a walk.

JOSH
Sir.

BARTLET
Come on.

Joey looks triumphant as she follows Bartlet out the office.

JOSH
Yes sir.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. and Carol are walking through the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE towards C.J.’S OFFICE.

C.J.
Carol. Good. I need biographical information on Simon Cruz.

CAROL
Is it C-R-U-Z?

C.J.
I don’t know.

CAROL
What kind of biographical information?

C.J.
Gonna need to know how to spell his name for sure. 

They head down the hall as the camera follows Bartlet and Joey, who are trailed by 
Josh and Kenny.

BARTLET
Do you read lips?

JOEY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Joey?

JOEY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Is that short for Joanne?

JOEY
Josephine.

BARTLET
And your last name is Lucas?

JOEY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Is that Polish?

JOEY
Dutch.

BARTLET
Protestant?

JOEY
Quaker.

They walk into THE OVAL OFFICE. Joey is completely in awe.

BARTLET
Well, this is the Oval Office. Come in, please. Sit down. 

He sits on chair, with Joey and Kenny on the opposite couch. Josh stands by the door. 

BARTLET
Well, where did you go to school?

JOEY [KENNY]
UCLA and Stanford.

BARTLET
There’s a guy named Simon Cruz on death row. He’s going to be executed in about 36 
hours. What do you think I should do? 

JOEY [KENNY]
[thinks] Stay the execution.

BARTLET
Why?

JOEY [KENNY]
Because the state shouldn’t kill people.

BARTLET
He was found guilty of a double murder and drug trafficking.

JOEY [KENNY]
Send him to prison.

BARTLET
You’re against capital punishment.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Did you study St. Augustine at Stanford?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Thomas Aquinas?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Two pretty smart guys, right?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
They believed in that part of the Old Testament which said, “Who sheddeth a man’s 
blood by man shall his blood be shed.”

JOEY [KENNY]
And Immanuel Kant said that the death penalty is a categorical imperative. But, Mr. 
President, those writings are from other centuries.

BARTLET
I’ve got a Harris poll says seventy-one percent of the American people support capital 
punishment.

JOEY [KENNY]
That’s a political problem.

BARTLET
I’m a politician.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

Bartlet looks up at Josh, who gets the idea.

JOSH
Thank you, Mr. President. We should... [gestures to the door]

Everyone stands. Bartlet turns to walk to his desk, but Joey reaches out to get his 
attention.

JOEY
Excuse me.

JOEY [KENNY]
Mr. President, I’m here ‘cause I’m running a campaign for Bill O’Dwyer, who’s running...

BARTLET
In the California forty-sixth?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes sir.

BARTLET
O’Dwyer’s an empty shirt.

JOEY [KENNY]
Sir?

BARTLET
I don’t like guys who run for congress because they think it’s a great gig. Find 
yourself a live one and I’ll get interested. In the meantime, the devil you know 
beats the devil you don’t. And I like the devil I got.

JOEY [KENNY]
But, sir...

BARTLET
Josh will take care of you from here.

Joey and Kenny pass Josh as they leave the room and continue walking.

JOEY [KENNY]
We’re going back to the hotel.

KENNY
It was nice meeting you.

JOSH
[to Joey] Nice to meet you.

KENNY
That was me saying that.

JOSH
[to Joey] You didn’t have a good time meeting me?

Joey gives him the “universal sign.” 

JOSH
You know what, I actually know that sign. 

Joey spells out something else and leaves, followed by Kenny.

JOSH
Don’t know that one, but I can probably guess.

CUT TO: INT. JEWISH SYNAGOGUE - DAY
SUNDAY MORNING, 9:10 A.M.
A singer is walking down the aisle in the synagogue with her accompanist.

SINGER
I just want to go through this piece a few times.
 
The camera moves to RABBI GLASSMAN, who is sitting in a pew. Toby walks up from behind him.

TOBY
Rabbi Glassman.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Toby. I didn’t hear you, which is fairly unusual. 

TOBY
[chuckles] Yeah. [sits on a pew behind the rabbi]

RABBI GLASSMAN
You missed the end of my sermon yesterday.

TOBY
Yeah, well, I had to go back to my office and I think you know why.

RABBI GLASSMAN
A lawyer named Bobby Zane called me Friday night. He told me what was happening. 
He asked if I had any influence in Toby Ziegler. I told him clearly he hadn’t spent 
any time with Toby Ziegler.

The singer starts her song in the background.

TOBY
Um? [gestures to singer]

RABBI GLASSMAN
Oh. I’m having a funeral service in the morning. She’s practicing a piece.

TOBY
That’s funny.

RABBI GLASSMAN
What?

TOBY
I never imagined the practicing.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Day and night.

TOBY
Rabbi. You - and Bobby Zane - what were you expecting of me when you gave your sermon 
yesterday?

RABBI GLASSMAN
Well, I suppose it was some hope you might take the Sabbath day to consider your 
position.

TOBY
As Communications Director, uh, I’m a counselor to the President to be sure. But my 
role in these situations is generally... I create a public face for what... I don’t 
influence policy.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Of course you do.

TOBY
You want me to go into the Oval Office and say, “Vengeance is not Jewish”?

RABBI 
[shrugs] Why not?

TOBY
Well, for one thing, neither is the President!

RABBI GLASSMAN
You can say all you want about the Catholic Church, but their position on life is 
unimpeachable. No abortion, no death penalty.

TOBY
Look, I... I spent the day...

RABBI GLASSMAN
You spent the day hoping the President wouldn’t call the Pope.

TOBY
You’re damn right. I did.

RABBI GLASSMAN
If he had commuted the sentence after talking to the Pope, the worst fears of every 
non-Catholic who voted for him would be realized. 

Both chuckle.

TOBY
Congratulations, Rabbi Glassman, you may now join the White House communications staff.

RABBI GLASSMAN
Look, Toby, you look like you’re having a long weekend. I appreciate the courtesy of 
you stopping by. 

TOBY
Yeah, well, you’re welcome. [Both get up.] The Torah doesn’t prohibit capital punishment.

RABBI GLASSMAN
No.

TOBY
It says, “An eye for an eye.”

RABBI GLASSMAN
You know what it also says? It says a rebellious child can be brought to the city gates 
and stoned to death. It says homosexuality is an abomination and punishable by death. 
It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable. For all I know, that thinking 
reflected the best wisdom of its time, but it’s just plain wrong by any modern standard. 
Society has a right to protect itself, but it doesn’t have a right to be vengeful. It 
has a right to punish, but it doesn’t have to kill.

TOBY
You know what I think? I think you knew I was coming back here. And I think you put her 
there on purpose. [gestures to singer]

RABBI GLASSMAN
She’s our communications director.

TOBY
[chuckles] Yeah. Well, anyway. 

RABBI GLASSMAN
Shalom, Toby.

TOBY
Shalom, Rabbi. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is sitting in her office, looking at a picture of three children playing. She 
is obviously bothered by something. Mandy comes in.

MANDY
C.J.

C.J.
Yeah.

MANDY
You have everything you need?

C.J.
Yeah.

MANDY
I mean for a briefing.

C.J.
I have his biographical information. His mother’s name is Sophia. Sophia.

MANDY
You’re gonna need more than that.

C.J.
I have more than that.

MANDY
Okay. [starts to leave]

C.J.
You know, I have no position on capital punishment. I try to get worked up about it, 
it seems like I should. But the truth is, I honestly don’t care if Simon Cruz lives 
or dies. And I suppose if it brings some measure of comfort to the families of the 
victims, then why the hell not.

MANDY
That’s valid.

C.J.
So, here’s my job tonight. If this thing happens. [opens a folder, puts on glasses 
and starts to read] “At 12:01, he’ll get the injection...”

MANDY
C.J. [comes next to C.J.’S desk]

C.J.
No, I’m saying, I’m reading it, right here. “The first sign of death will be his hands 
twitching. After sixty seconds, he’ll strain against the straps, his head will have 
snapped back violently, and after ninety seconds he’ll be in convulsions. At 12:04, 
he’ll be pronounced dead.”

MANDY
He killed two people, probably more. I’m sorry. I don’t get worked up over it.

C.J.
Me neither. That’s what I’m saying, me neither. Except... at 12:04, ‘cause that’s when 
the warden calls me. That’s my job tonight. I have to go in and tell the President that 
Simon Cruz is dead and we’re the ones who killed him. So... 
[pause] I just wish I didn’t know his mother’s name was Sophia, is all I’m saying. 

MANDY
[beat]
Okay.

Mandy leaves. C.J. continues to stare into space, looking even more upset.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
SUNDAY, 6:15 P.M.
Bartlet is sitting at his desk, reading. Nancy comes in.

NANCY
Mr. President, Toby’s here.

BARTLET
Okay.

TOBY
[comes in] Good afternoon, sir. Welcome back. 

BARTLET
Thank you.

TOBY
How was your trip?

BARTLET
Fine. What do you need?

TOBY
I had a strange experience this weekend. One of the P.D.s on the Cruz case, I guess 
trying the things you do when you’re desperate, he went and spoke to my rabbi.

BARTLET
Jewish law doesn’t prohibit...

TOBY
I know.

BARTLET
The commandment does not say, “Thou shalt not kill.” It says, “Thou shalt not murder.”

TOBY
I know. But the fact is that, even two thousand years ago, the rabbis of the Talmud 
couldn’t... [tries to find the right word] ...stomach it. I mean, they weren’t about 
to rewrite the Torah, but they came up with another way. They came up with legal 
restrictions, which make our criminal justice system look... They made it impossible 
for the state... to punish someone by killing them. 

BARTLET
We make it very hard to kill anybody in this country, Toby.

TOBY
It should be impossible.

BARTLET
But it’s not.

TOBY
But it should be.

They just stare at each other until Leo comes in.

BARTLET
Hey.

LEO
Hey. What’s going on?

BARTLET
Toby went to Shul.

Leo looks back and forth between Bartlet and Toby.

TOBY
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. [leaves]

LEO
[sits in front of Bartlet] Japan opened huge.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
Up two cents against the Yen.

BARTLET
I commute this guy, for no particular reason other than I don’t like the death penalty...

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
And the next President sees it in a different way. I’ve laid track to all kinds of... 
The next guy is gonna have eighth amendment problems up the ass.

LEO
Well, if that’s the only thing that’s stopping you... 

BARTLET
We cannot execute some people and not execute others depending on the mood of the Oval 
Office. It’s cruel and unusual. 

LEO
If that’s the only thing stopping you, then I’ll say this for the first time in your 
Presidency... Let that be the next guy’s problem.

There’s a knock at the door, then Nancy sticks her head in.

NANCY
Sir. Sam Seaborn?

BARTLET
Okay. Give me a minute please, Nancy. [looks at Leo and shakes his head]

LEO
I’ll take care of it.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam and Charlie are just outside the Oval Office.

SAM
The U.S. is one of five countries on earth that puts to death people who’re under 
the age of 18 when they committed a crime.

CHARLIE
Nigeria.

SAM
Pakistan.

CHARLIE
Saudi Arabia and Iran?

SAM
Yeah. So, that’s a list we definitely want to be on. 

LEO
[comes out of the Oval Office] Sam.

SAM
Leo, I put my notes together. I...

LEO
Walk with me.

SAM
Actually, I was hoping to see the President.

LEO
You’re not going to see the President, Sam.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
He’s done.

SAM
We have six hours...

LEO
He’s done.

They head off walking into the HALLWAY.

SAM
Leo, it’s not an impossible sell.

LEO
I’ve lived longer than you, Sam...

SAM
Leo.

LEO
[shouts] He’s done, and I gotta tell you, Sam, this was bungled. We were totally 
unprepared for this.

SAM
What the hell are you...?

LEO
We were caught in the headlights... This thing was supposed to go back to the sixth 
circuit. And I don’t know how it happened...

SAM
[shouts] What are you talking about, prepared? The court sat. What would you have 
done differently? [They stop walking.]

LEO
I’d have...

SAM
What would you have done different? You’d have kept the President out of the country 
another two days?

LEO
[quietly] Yes.

SAM
Leo, there are times when we are absolutely nowhere. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT
Josh is sitting at the bar in a hotel. Joey and Kenny come in to meet him.

JOSH
Hello. [to Kenny] Hi.

KENNY
Hi.

JOSH
[to Joey] Thank you for meeting me.

JOEY [KENNY]
Our flight’s in one hour.

JOSH
Aren’t you impressed that I was able to track you down?

JOEY [KENNY]
Was it hard?

JOSH
It was very hard. I had to have my assistant call your office in California. 

Joey looks disgusted.

JOSH
It’s funny, when I say it out loud like that, it doesn’t sound that impressive.

JOEY [KENNY]
Do you make me meet you here so you could do more jokes?

JOSH
[gets serious] No, I came at the request of the President. He wanted you to know 
that he felt that he was rude to you in the Oval Office yesterday. He apologizes 
if he was abrupt about your problem and while the tightening of your funding was 
political strategy on our part, he honestly feels that your candidate is a schmuck 
who gives liberalism a bad name.

Joey thinks about this, and then smiles.

JOEY [KENNY]
Yeah, I think so too.

JOSH
[with a big grin] I know you do. Why are you working for him?

JOEY [KENNY]
I’m a professional political operative. I need to work. I mean, it’s not exactly 
like there’s a seller’s market for deaf campaign managers.

JOSH
I’d imagine. He also wanted me to tell you that he meant what he said. Come up with 
a live one and we’ll get interested in a hurry. [puts money on the bar for his drink]

JOEY [KENNY]
Did he have any suggestions?

JOSH
As a matter of fact, he did.

JOEY
Who?

JOSH
[whispers] You. 

Joey looks shocked. 

JOSH
You guys have a nice flight back. 

Joey looks absolutely stunned as she watches him go.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
SUNDAY, 11:57 P.M.
Bartlet is standing at the window in the Oval Office. He is looking out at the 
falling snow and holding a rosary. Charlie comes in.

CHARLIE
Mr. President? [beat] Excuse me, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
Father Cavanaugh.

BARTLET
Thank you. 

He walks to the door. FATHER THOMAS CAVANAUGH enters.

BARTLET
Tom.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Mr. President. [They hug.]

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie. 

Charlie leaves.

BARTLET
Thanks for coming all this way down.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
It was no trouble. I’m just sorry I couldn’t get here until now.

BARTLET
Yeah, it seems like a wasted trip.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Oh. I can see the Oval Office.

BARTLET
This is it. 

They walk farther into the room. 

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Show me around the room.

BARTLET
You’re looking at the room.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Well, uh, where’s the red phone?

BARTLET
We don’t use the red phone anymore.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Well, how do you talk to the Kremlin?
 
BARTLET
I tell Mrs. Landingham I want to talk to the Kremlin. Would you like a drink?

FATHER CAVANAUGH
No. No thanks. [pause] I don’t know how to address you. Would you prefer Jed or 
Mr. President?

BARTLET
To be honest, I prefer Mr. President.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
That’s fine.

BARTLET
You understand why, right?

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Do I need to know why?

BARTLET
It’s not ego.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
I didn’t think it was.

BARTLET
There are certain decisions I have to make while I’m in this room. Do I send troops 
into harm’s way? Which fatal disease gets the most research money?

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Sure.

BARTLET
It’s helpful in those situations not to think of yourself as the man but as the office.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Then Mr. President it is.

BARTLET
I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the 
public would find palatable to commute the sentence. A technicality. Any evidence of 
racism.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
So your staff spent the weekend looking for a way out.

BARTLET
Yeah.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Like the kid in right field who doesn’t want the ball to get hit to him.

They sit down.

BARTLET
I’m the leader of a democracy, Tom. Seventy-one percent of the people support capital 
punishment. People have spoken. The courts have spoken.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Did you call the Pope?

BARTLET
Yeah.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
And how do you do that?

BARTLET
[upset] Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, “Somebody get me the Pope.”

FATHER CAVANAUGH
No, I’m sorry, Mr. President, but I was thinking... You’re just this kid from my parish 
and now you’re calling the Pope.

BARTLET
Anyway. I looked for a way out, I really did.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
“‘Vengeance is mine,’ sayeth the Lord.” You know what that means? God is the only one 
who gets to kill people.

BARTLET
I know.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
That was your way out.

BARTLET
I know.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Did you pray?

BARTLET
I did, Tom. I know it’s hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
And none came?

BARTLET
[shakes his head] It never has. And I’m a little pissed off about that. 

He looks at his watch, which says it’s a few seconds before midnight. It hits him hard.

BARTLET
[dead serious] I’m not kidding.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
You know, you remind me of the man that lived by the river. He heard a radio report 
that the river was going to rush up and flood the town. And that all the residents 
should evacuate their homes. But the man said, “I’m religious. I pray. God loves me. 
God will save me.” The waters rose up. A guy in a row boat came along and he shouted, 
“Hey, hey you! You in there. The town is flooding. Let me take you to safety.” But the 
man shouted back, “I’m religious. I pray. God loves me. God will save me.” A helicopter 
was hovering overhead. And a guy with a megaphone shouted, “Hey you, you down there. 
The town is flooding. Let me drop this ladder and I’ll take you to safety.” But the 
man shouted back that he was religious, that he prayed, that God loved him and that 
God will take him to safety. Well... the man drowned. And standing at the gates of 
St. Peter, he demanded an audience with God. “Lord,” he said, “I’m a religious man, 
I pray. I thought you loved me. Why did this happen?” God said, “I sent you a radio 
report, a helicopter, and a guy in a rowboat. What the hell are you doing here?”

He pauses. Bartlet looks very upset.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
He sent you a priest, a rabbi, and a Quaker, Mr. President. Not to mention his son, 
Jesus Christ. What do you want from him?

There is a knock on the door.

C.J.
Excuse me.

C.J. comes in, hands Bartlet a note, and leaves. Bartlet reads the note, and then 
crumples it up as he goes to lean on the desk. He looks exceedingly troubled.

FATHER CAVANAUGH
Jed. Would you like me to hear your confession?

BARTLET
Yes, please.

Father Cavanaugh pulls out his stole and puts it on. The President kneels beside him, 
over the Presidential seal. He performs the sign of the cross.

BARTLET
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned...
