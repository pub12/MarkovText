TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
Police cars, motorcycles and limousines arrive. Sirens are heard everywhere.

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Charlie are in one of the limos. 

BARTLET 
He wants to meet with me on the way back? 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
On the way back? 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
The Assistant Energy Secretary is flying to Portland in the middle of the night so he 
can meet with me on Air Force One on the way back? 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
The day-to-day experience of my life has changed in many ways since taking this job. 

CHARLIE 
I would imagine, sir. 

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BUS - CONTINUOUS
At the end of the motorcade, C.J. is sitting in front of the press bus, facing the many 
reporters who are accompanying Bartlet on the trip. 

C.J. 
Before we get on the plane, let me give you a couple of additions to the passenger 
manifest. Gerald Wegland, the Assistant Energy Secretary, is now on the flight, as 
well as Mr. Latham, the head of The White House Military Office, or WHAMO, as we have 
apparently taken - over my strong objection - to calling it. [Reporters giggle.] 
Also, on this evening's trip are Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn and, 
well, me. 

DANNY 
I thought you weren't going on the trip. 

C.J. 
I am now going on the trip. 

DANNY 
Are you being punished? 

C.J. 
I'm not being punished, I'm going on the trip. 

DANNY 
If the whole bus goes off the record, will you tell us why you're going on the trip? 

C.J. 
[watches everyone carefully] I made fun of Notre Dame. 

REPORTERS 
Oh! Aww! Man! No! 

C.J. 
I usually get away with it! 

KATIE 
They're playing Michigan tomorrow. 

C.J. 
I know that now. 

DANNY 
You can't bring that stuff when they're playing Michigan. 

C.J. 
Well, I'll have a lot of time to think about that on the midnight ride to Portland, 
Danny. The wheels-up is 905. We'll touch down in Portland a little before midnight 
local time. 

CUT TO: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
Leo approaches Bartlet's limo. Engines roar nearby. 

LEO 
Mr. President? 

BARTLET 
How're you doing? 

LEO 
I just got off with Bruno and Hess. 

BARTLET 
I'm sorry? 

LEO 
I said I just got off with Bruno and Hess. 

BARTLET 
You didn't say 'Michigan sucks'? 

LEO 
No, sir. 

BARTLET 
I thought you said 'Michigan sucks.' 

LEO 
No, sir. We're standing pretty close to the engines so it may have sounded like I said, 
'Notre Dame is gonna get the ass-kicking they so richly deserve.' Bruno and Hess? 

BARTLET 
Yeah. 

LEO 
We stopped the tanker in the Gulf. 

BARTLET 
Whose? 

LEO 
It's Cyprus-flagged but they tracked them coming out of Qais. 

BARTLET 
You think they've got oil? 

LEO 
Yeah. 

BARTLET 
We gonna board them? 

LEO 
Yeah. 

BARTLET 
Anything else I should know? 

LEO 
No, sir. 

BARTLET 
I'll see you tomorrow night. 

LEO 
Have a good flight, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
Thank you! 

C.J. approaches from the side, Leo waves to her and leaves.

BARTLET
Hey, C.J.! 

C.J. 
Good evening, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
I think it's great you decided to make the trip. 

C.J. 
I believe I was ordered to, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
Yes. I remember now. You made one of your funny, funny jokes. 

C.J. 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
Put it on. 

C.J. 
Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
Put it on. 

C.J. 
Sir, I'm wearing Max Mara. It's going to break up the... 

BARTLET 
Put it on! 

C.J. puts on the Notre Dame cap and grins at the officer in front of the plane door. 

C.J. 
Please let nobody see me like this. 

BARTLET 
Hey, photo op. 

C.J. 
Oh good god. 

They turn to the people below the plane and wave. Bartlet - enthusiastically, 
C.J. - barely. 

BARTLET 
Let's hit the sky!

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Josh is sitting at his desk. 

JOSH
Did he look tired? 

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Leo is sitting inside. He is on the phone in the car.

LEO 
No, he looked fine. 

JOSH 
You told him about the tanker? 

LEO 
Yeah. I wish he'd cancel the event, it's a long flight. 

JOSH 
He likes long flights, he gets to talk to everybody and think out loud. 

LEO 
Yeah, but then he lands. 

JOSH 
Yeah, so... well, then he lands. [beat] Anyway, I'm going to meet with Matt Skinner. 

LEO 
Tonight? 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

LEO 
He's gonna say the language in the bill doesn't prohibit. 

JOSH 
Yeah, but it creates a Federal Definition. 

During this conversation, Donna, wearing a stunning red dress, comes in, turns off 
Josh's PC and laptop, picks up his feet to collect papers from his desk and flicks 
off the table lamp. 

LEO 
Still, at the State level... 

JOSH 
Yeah. Are you sticking around tonight? 

LEO 
The President's going to have to make a decision from the plane. 

JOSH 
Okay. I have to go. Donna is about to cease the phone. 

LEO 
All right. 

JOSH 
Leo. He likes long plane rides. 

LEO 
Yeah. Josh hangs up the phone. 

JOSH 
Can I have the electricity back on? 

DONNA 
No. 

She walks out of the office to JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. Josh follows.

JOSH 
Why not? 

DONNA 
It's time to go. 

JOSH 
Not for me. Matt Skinner's coming down from the Hill. 

DONNA 
[turns to Josh] When did this happen? 

JOSH 
Two minutes ago. Did you have plans? 

DONNA 
Did I have plans! 

JOSH 
Did you? 

DONNA 
Look at me! 

Josh looks.

JOSH 
Hey, you look GOOD! 

DONNA 
Yes, I do! 

She walks away. Josh follows again.

JOSH 
You weren't wearing that during the day today. 

DONNA 
Pity the girl who tries to get something past you, Josh. 

JOSH 
Did you steal that dress? 

DONNA 
I bought this dress. 

JOSH 
But you're returning it tomorrow. 

DONNA 
Yes, I am. 

JOSH 
That's stealing! 

DONNA 
I'm giving it back. 

JOSH 
After wearing it once. 

DONNA 
There's a word for this. 

JOSH 
It's "stealing"! 

DONNA 
[puts on her coat] I'm a girl on a budget, Josh. I'm being thrifty. 

JOSH 
And felonious. What are your plans? 

DONNA 
Look... 

JOSH 
What are your plans? 

DONNA 
We're having drinks, we're having dinner, we are going dancing, we are having dessert. 

JOSH 
No problem. You can do all those things except for the drinks, the dancing, and the 
dessert. 

DONNA 
Josh... 

JOSH 
I need you to be done with dinner in an hour and five minutes. 

DONNA 
[shows him her dress again] Do you see what I'm wearing? 

JOSH 
If you wanna have sex, you'd better do it during dinner. 

DONNA 
[walks closer to him] This is the guy, Josh. This is a great guy. His name is Todd. 

JOSH 
[smiling goofily] You met him for five minutes at a party. 

DONNA 
I got the good vibe. 

JOSH 
Okay. [turns back to his office] 

DONNA 
I have an excellent sense about these things! 

JOSH 
[turns back, yelling] Actually, you have NO sense about these things! You have no vibe, 
you have terrible taste in men, and your desire to be coupled up will always and forever 
drown out any small sense of self or self-worth that you may have. 

DONNA 
[as her smile fades and about to cry] You're a downer, you know that? I'm calling you 
Deputy Downer from now on! 

She leaves the bullpen. Josh watches her go. Then walks to his office. 

JOSH 
Be back by the time I'm done with Skinner! 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
Sam is sitting in a chair, looking nowhere. He's holding his speech carelessly in 
his hand. 

PILOT [via P.A.]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck. We're just passing through 
20,000 feet en route to our cruising altitude of 38,000 feet. Our flight plan this 
evening will take us over Pittsburgh and Cleveland, passing 190 miles south of the 
University of Notre Dame, then over Radic City, South Dakota; Casper, Wyoming, to... 

During the announcement, Sam jumps suddenly, and walks into a CABIN where Toby is 
sitting in an armchair. 

SAM 
Toby? 

TOBY 
Let me see it. 

SAM 
Could I talk to you a second? 

TOBY 
Is it done? 

SAM 
It... it's not... it's not good. It's not going well. 

TOBY 
We've had meetings... 

SAM 
Yeah, Toby... 

TOBY 
For the past three weeks! 

SAM 
I'm not confused about policy. 

TOBY 
What's the problem? 

SAM 
I'm not writing well. I'm just... I'd rather not distribute this to the pool yet. 

The steward walks into the cabin. 

STEWARD 
Mr. Ziegler, Mr. Seaborn, do you know what you'd like for dinner? 

TOBY
[gets up] We'll be eating in the conference room. I'll have a club sandwich, Jack Daniels 
and ice. 

STEWARD 
Mr. Seaborn? 

SAM 
Nothing for me. 

TOBY 
You have to have something. 

SAM 
I'm fine. [He looks horrible.]

TOBY 
[to the steward] Bring him a club sandwich. 

STEWARD 
Yes, sir.

They walk out of the room. C.J. is coming down the stairs to meet them. 

TOBY 
Nice hat. 

C.J. 
Shut up! 

TOBY
[beat] Sam and I are going to work for a little bit, you'll have draft copies to 
distribute to the press in about three hours. 

C.J. 
It was already distributed. 

SAM 
W-what do you mean? 

C.J. 
It was already distributed. 

SAM 
You have to get it back! 

C.J. 
I can't get it back. 

SAM 
C.J.... 

C.J. 
They know you're polishing it... 

SAM 
I'm doing more than polishing it, C.J., you've got to get it back! 

C.J. 
I'll tell them there's a new draft and then you should... 

SAM 
You've got to get the old draft back! 

C.J. 
They're not going to read it! 

SAM 
They might. 

C.J. 
So what? 

SAM 
It's very bad writing and it's got my fingerprints all over it! 

C.J. 
[laughs] Sam! 

TOBY 
C.J., try to get it back. [walks past them, to Sam] C'mon. 

STEWARD
Ms. Cregg, do you know what you'd like for dinner? 

SAM 
[pops up on extreme right, whispers] Try to get it back? 

C.J. 
Uh... yeah. 

STEWARD 
Ms. Cregg, you know what you'd like for dinner? 

C.J. 
[walking] We've got pasta... salad? 

STEWARD 
It's good. 

C.J. 
I'll take it. 

Bartlet and Charlie approach C.J. 

BARTLET 
C.J.! 

C.J. 
Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
What does the island of Qais mean to you? 

C.J. 
[rolls her eyes, walks by him] I know it's known as a rendezvous point for Iraqi oil 
smugglers. 

BARTLET 
About two hours ago we stopped a Cyprus-flagged ship called "The Nicosia." We believe 
it to be carrying petroleum products out of Iraq, in violation of UN sanctions. 

C.J. 
What do we do when that happens? 

BARTLET 
We board the stip, we test a sample of the oil, we determine its point of origin and 
if it's black-market, the oil company gets fined. 

C.J. 
Don't they also get to sell the oil? 

BARTLET 
Yes. 

C.J. 
Doesn't the profit of the sale exceed the fine? 

BARTLET 
It dramatically exceeds the fine! So what do you think we should do? 

C.J. 
If you're going to have sanctions, have sanctions. There should be genuine disincentive. 

BARTLET 
I agree. Charlie? 

CHARLIE 
[hands C.J. some papers] Here you go. 

C.J. 
What's this? 

CHARLIE 
The lyrics to the Notre Dame fight song. 

BARTLET 
It would please me if you would lead the press in a rendition as we pass over South Bend. 

C.J. 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
All five verses, please. 

C.J. 
[clutches her fists] Go Irish! 

BARTLET 
You bet your ass! 

Bartlet and Charlie walk away as C.J. stands still with her fist still clutched.

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Ainsley, with a fan in her hand, walks into the cafeteria. 

WAITER 
Yes, ma'am? 

AINSLEY 
Yes, could I have a chocolate chip muffin, a can of Fresca and a bag of ice, please? 

WAITER 
We don't have Fresca. 

AINSLEY 
Really? 

WAITER 
No, ma'am. 

AINSLEY 
You should really have Fresca. 

WAITER 
Yes, ma'am. 

LEO 
[comes up to Ainsley] Ainsley! 

AINSLEY 
Good evening, Leo! 

LEO 
What's with the fan? 

AINSLEY 
I just went and got it from my apartment. [picks up food and they walk to exit] 

LEO 
It's seventeen degrees outside. 

AINSLEY 
Then I should move my desk outside, because it's a hundred and three in my office. 

LEO 
The heat's not working? 

AINSLEY
No, the heat's working great, I can vouch for that personally. 

LEO 
Okay. 

They walk in different directions.

AINSLEY 
You should really have Fresca in the building! 

LEO [OS] 
I'll get right on that! 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Congressman Matt Skinner knocks on his office door. He is a short, neatly-dressed good 
looking man in his thirties. 

JOSH 
Hey, Matt. 

SKINNER 
You let Donna out? [They shake hands.] 

JOSH 
Temporarily. She's having dinner. 

SKINNER 
Oh, with who? 

JOSH 
I guy she has no future with. 

SKINNER 
Why no future? 

JOSH 
Because I say so. You want some coffee or something? 

SKINNER 
Uh... you got a beer? 

JOSH 
Yeah. [gets two bottles from the refrigerator] It's too bad this is going to be rushed. 

SKINNER 
Sorry? 

JOSH 
It's too bad we're talking about this for the first time right now. 

SKINNER 
I would have thought that was by design. 

JOSH 
Really? 

SKINNER 
Ten days are up tomorrow. 

JOSH 
We know. 

SKINNER 
We know you know. [Josh and Skinner sit down.] Josh, the language doesn't prohibit 
same-sex marriage. 

JOSH 
Of course it does. 

SKINNER 
It ensures that, for the purposes of Federal programs... 

JOSH 
That government will define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. 

SKINNER 
That's right, while doing nothing to prohibit gay marriage on a state level. 

JOSH 
While doing nothing to prohibit it? 

SKINNER 
If you look at the language... 

JOSH 
Matt. 

SKINNER 
Yeah? 

JOSH 
When this bill was being discussed on the floor, there were some very ugly things said 
about homosexuals. 

SKINNER 
Yes. 

JOSH 
They were said by members of your own party. In fact, they were said by one of the guys 
who escorted you here tonight, who's sitting out in the lobby. 

SKINNER 
Yes, they were. 

JOSH 
You support this bill? 

SKINNER 
Yes, I do. 

JOSH 
Congressman... you're gay! 

SKINNER 
Yes, I am. 

They look at each other, and Skinner smiles.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Leo enters as a Navy officer MARK CHASE is waiting for him. 

LEO 
What's going on, Mark? 

MARK CHASE
The Sudanese captain of the tanker refused to let the Navy personnel on board. 

LEO 
Oh, man. 

MARK 
CH-47 Seahawk helicopter was dispatched from the destroyer 'USS Monterey.' The copter 
tried to land, but seamen obstructed the deck with freight. 

LEO 
What else did they obstruct the deck with? 

MARK 
They fired warning shots. 

LEO 
From what? 

MARK 
Russian-made Kalashnikovs. 

LEO 
AK-47s. 

MARK 
Yes, at which point the Seahawk retreated to its carrier group. 

LEO 
Where are we now? 

MARK 
Central Command's going to have two F-18s buzz the ship, fire warning shots over the bow. 

LEO 
There's no way this ends well. In fact, its' already over.

MARK 
It's not over yet. 

LEO 
Trust me. I'll call the President. [walks out] 

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Margaret enters Leo's office, stands by his desk, and looks at him. 

LEO
Yeah? 

MARGARET
You have a phone call. 

LEO
From whom? 

MARGARET
Can I just say that all I meant before was that if I was married and got divorced and 
my divorce papers came and I was an alcoholic, I would want to be...

LEO
Who's on the phone? 

MARGARET
The President. 

LEO 
[gives her a glare, picking up phone quickly] Yes, sir? 

BARTLET [VO]
What's our goal? 

LEO
I'm sorry, sir? 

BARTLET
What are we trying to do? 

LEO
We're trying to seize the ship and escort it to Bahrain. 

BARTLET
All right. The F-18 pilots? 

LEO
They fire warning shots, maybe take out the propeller... 

BARTLET
Leo, just so they know--it's a tanker full of crude oil. If they miss the propeller and 
hit something else--- 

LEO
They know. Excuse me, Mr. President. [whispering to Margaret] Would you stop looking at 
me like that? 

Margaret turns and leaves quickly. 

BARTLET
What was that? 

LEO
Margaret was giving me a look. 

BARTLET
Why? 

LEO
My divorce papers came today. She thinks I'm going to drink 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is in his cabin, talking on the phone.

	VALHALLA VECTOR - JET ROUTE 23
	WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA

BARTLET
I didn't know that. 

LEO
Don't worry about it, Mr. President. I'll keep you posted. 

BARTLET
Okay. Why don't I have a final draft of tomorrow morning's...? 

LEO
Toby and Sam are working on it. 

BARTLET
What's wrong with it? 

LEO
Sam doesn't like the writing. 

BARTLET
Sam wrote it. 

LEO
He's taking another swing. 

BARTLET
All right. [hangs up] 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
Sam and are Toby working on the speech.

TOBY
Read it to me. 

SAM
[reading] 'I'm calling on all Americans, young and old, Democrat and Republican, 
or none of the above, to make education a national priority.' 

TOBY
Okay. 

SAM
[sighing] "None of the above." It's a pedestrian phrase and has no place. [crosses it out] 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM
Also when was education not a national priority before? 

TOBY 
Right. [clearing throat] It's an easy fix. All we need to do is...

SAM
No. 

TOBY
No what? 

SAM
No, it's not an easy fix. 

TOBY
Sam? 

SAM
This should...

TOBY
Yeah? 

SAM
Oratory should raise your heart rate. Oratory should blow the doors off the place. We 
should be talking about not being satisfied with past solutions, we should be talking 
about a permanent revolution. 

TOBY 
[pausing and thinking] Where have I heard that? 

SAM
Permanent revolution? 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM 
[darkly] I got it from a book. 

TOBY
What book? 

SAM
The Little Red Book. 

TOBY
You think we should quote Mao Tse-tung? 

SAM
We do need a permanent revolution. 

TOBY
Still, I think we'll stay away from quoting Communists. 

SAM
You think a Communist never wrote an elegant phrase? 

TOBY
Sam... 

SAM
How do you think they got every to be Communist? 

TOBY
[sighing] Let's take a walk. 

SAM
Toby, you're the one for the last six months who's been saying we need a radical 
approach...

TOBY 
[raising his voice] Yes, yes I have, and I got shouted down in every meeting! I'd love 
to write a speech about a radical new approach to education, but we don't have one! So 
unless we can come up with an idea and implement it before land in Portland, I'd prefer 
not to paint a picture in the interest of great oratory. [sighs] Let's take a walk. 

SAM
Can't great oratory inspire an idea that can be implemented? 

TOBY
We had six months. We're not doing it half-assed, we're not doing it tonight. Let's go. 

SAM
Where? 

TOBY
Up and down the plane, get the blood flowing. 

SAM
Mao knew how to get the blood flowing. 

TOBY
Let's go. 

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
Donna enters the West Wing. Leo joins her, walking. 

LEO
Hey, Donna. 

DONNA
Good evening. 

LEO
That's a nice dress. 

DONNA
Thank you, sir. 

LEO
You weren't wearing that dress earlier today, were you? 

DONNA
You guys are sharp as tacks, you know that? 

LEO
Did you have a date? 

DONNA
Yeah. 

LEO
With who? 

DONNA
It doesn't matter. 

LEO
Where'd ya eat? 

DONNA
Phoebe's. 

LEO
Ah, good. You know what you get there? Tell Dario, the chef, that you work for me and 
that you want flash-seared escolar with foie gras butter and a fresh juniper berry 
gravlax on a bed of shaved fennel. You have a nice '87 Petrus with that. [beat] 
What did you have? 

DONNA
Two whiskey sours and a bowl of soup. 

LEO
Ah, okay. 

DONNA
I should tell Josh I'm back. 

LEO
He's in the mess. 

DONNA
Thanks. Hey, Leo. I hope you don't mind. [clears throat] Margaret mentioned that your 
divorce...

LEO
Oh, come on. 

DONNA
She mentioned the papers came today...

LEO
Yeah.

DONNA
And she was worried that maybe...

LEO
Margaret worries if the sun is gonna rise. Go check in with Josh. 

DONNA
Okay. He's in the mess? 

LEO
Yeah. 

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Josh and Matt are in the mess, talking over a few beers. 

SKINNER
It passed. 

JOSH
I know. 

SKINNER
It passed the Senate...

JOSH
I know, man. 

SKINNER
With 85 votes. 29 Democrats voted for it. It passed the House with 342 votes. Our polling 
numbers are the same as yours. 60% of Americans oppose legally sanctioned gay marriage. 
The people want the bill. Congress wants the bill. The President needs to sign the bill. 

JOSH
Public opinion can be wrong, Matt. The public opposed interracial marriage and school 
integration. You want me to reach back into the nostalgia file? 

SKINNER
That's entirely different. 

JOSH
[exasperated] How's it different? 

SKINNER
The government has a responsibility to protect the rights of minorities, but it can't 
impose the minority's values on the majority. 

JOSH
Freedom of choice isn't a minority value just because the majority doesn't agree with 
the minority's choice. 

DONNA
[enters] Excuse me. 

JOSH
Hey. 

DONNA
I'm back. 

SKINNER
Hey, Donna. 

DONNA
Hey, Congressman. 

SKINNER
How was your date? 

DONNA
Uh, it was good. Josh, I'll be around. 

JOSH
Thanks. 

Donna exits, Matt and Josh watch her leave. 

SKINNER
Josh, all the Marriage Recognition Act does is ensure that a radical social agenda isn't 
thrust upon an entire country that isn't ready for it yet. 

JOSH
32 States have passed laws banning same-sex marriage. The States are doing a fine job 
protecting themselves from a radical social agenda without a federal shield. 

SKINNER
Josh...

JOSH
I like you guys who want to reduce the size of government and make it just small enough 
so it can fit in our bedrooms! 

SKINNER
When do you have to call the President? 

JOSH
[glancing at his watch] I got time. 

SKINNER
[loosening his tie] Let's have another beer. 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, PRESS AREA - NIGHT
C.J. taps Carol on the shoulder, adjusts her Notre Dame cap, and enters the press seating. 

C.J.
How's everybody doing? 

STEVE
C.J., why'd the flight take off so late? 

C.J.
We took off on time. 

STEVE
No, I mean why was it scheduled late? I'm doing a side-bar. 

C.J.
I'm not sure. The President had a budget meeting earlier, maybe they were expecting it 
to run long, I'll find out. Listen, I'd like you to give me back the draft copies of the 
morning education speech. We're going to replace them. 

REPORTER
Why the change? 

C.J.
Toby and Sam are doing some work. 

STEVE
Is there a policy shift? 

C.J..
No. 

STEVE
A new program? 

C.J.
They're just polishing the language. 

STEVE
Well, C.J., if there's a policy shift or a new program, it'd help to have the old text 
to compare it with...

C.J.
There isn't a policy shift, there isn't a new program, this is Sam being Sam. 

Charlie enters and gets C.J.'s attention. 

REPORTER
Has political pressure from the NEA forced changes in the...

C.J.
Nothing's forced changes in the speech, there are no policy shifts and no new 
initiatives, I guarantee you. Carol? 

CAROL
Yeah. 

C.J.
[leaving with Charlie] Excuse me. 

CAROL
Guys, they're in your press packets, if you could just hand them forward... 

CHARLIE
He wanted me to tell you that we're approaching South Bend and that he likes to hear 
the song at a brisk and steady tempo. 

C.J.
[staring at Charlie] Oh, kill me now! 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Margaret enters. Leo is reading.

MARGARET
Leo. 

LEO 
[motions her to wait a second] Yeah? 

MARGARET
Colonel Chase. 

LEO 
[as Mark enters] Mark, tell me we didn't hit anything. 

MARK
No, F-18s fired over the bow and the tanker stopped. 

LEO
We boarded? 

MARK
Yeah, but the crew threw the log and the registry overboard. 

LEO
Mark! 

MARK
Also the ship's manifest. 

LEO
How do these people think this is going to end? What is their best-case scenario? 

MARK
I just go where you point me. I'm going to have to brief Fitzwallace now. 

LEO
Yeah, thanks, Mark. 

Mark exits. 

LEO
Margaret! 

MARGARET 
[entering] Yeah? 

LEO
Can you get me Secretaries Hutchinson and Berryhill? 

MARGARET
Yeah. 

LEO
And I need Air Force One the next free minute he's got, okay? 

MARGARET
Yeah. 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT'S CABIN - NIGHT
The President is with two advisors, Steve Adamley and Mike. 

STEVE
That's usually pretty hard to get through Congress. 

BARTLET
Why? 

STEVE
Subway money. 

BARTLET
It's a northeastern thing? 

STEVE
Once you get south of DC or west of Chicago, there aren't any subways, and the ones 
they've got, nobody's using. 

BARTLET
What about Miami and San Francisco? 

Someone knocks.

BARTLET
Come in! 

STEVE
L.A., Miami, San Francisco, maybe someday, but nobody's using them now. 

C.J. enters. Mike stares at her hat. She stares back. He smiles just a little. 

BARTLET
So pavement's going to win this battle? 

ADVISOR [VO]
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Okay, thanks, Steve. 

They all rise as the advisors exit. 

STEVE
Thank you, Mr. President. 

MIKE
Thank you. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Mike. 

STEVE 
[to C.J.] Nice hat. 

C.J.
Thank you. 

BARTLET 
[putting on jacket] Ernesto Perez Balladares, former President of Panama. You know where 
he went to school? Notre Dame. 

C.J.
Yes, sir, also Joe Garagiola. 

BARTLET
Was that a crack? 

C.J.
No, sir. I understand you'd like to hear the song now? 

BARTLET 
[as he and C.J. walk out] Yeah, but we gotta do it later. The Tokyo Exchange just opened 
and I'm gonna gauge the impact on Pacific Rim Banking Reforms. A subject economics 
scholars could take years on, I will take 20 minutes. 

C.J.
Speaking of which, Mr. President, I was asked about the late departure tonight. 

BARTLET
I thought we left on time. 

C.J.
The late scheduled departure. 

BARTLET
You don't like late flights? 

C.J.
No, I was just repeating- 

Bartlet and C.J. enter another cabin. Sam and Toby are seated.

BARTLET 
A long flight across the night? You know why late flights are good? Because we cease to 
be earthbound and burdened with practicality. Ask the impertinent question. Talk about 
the idea nobody has thought about yet. [pointing to Sam] Put it a different way. 

SAM
Be poets. 

BARTLET
If you absolutely must. 

SAM
Tell Toby. 

TOBY
Sam...

SAM
He doesn't want to use the phrase "permanent revolution." 

BARTLET
In education? 

SAM
Yes. 

TOBY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Mao took a lot of long plane flights, Toby. Look out your window. Is there anything more 
romantic than that? [pointing out cabin window] 

C.J.
And that's why we left at 905? 

BARTLET
No, we left at 905 because they thought my budget meeting might run over. But wouldn't 
that have been great if that was the reason? 

SAM
[looking up] Yes. 

BARTLET
[to Toby] You don't like "permanent revolution"? 

A phone rings in background. 

TOBY
It's a nifty phrase, but I think if we call for a permanent revolution, people 
are, you know, gonna expect one. 

CHARLIE 
[holding phone] Mr. President? 

BARTLET
We're flying, Toby. Live a little. [standing and walking to Charlie] Yeah? 

CHARLIE
Mr. McGarry. 

BARTLET
Oh, Leo, just take the damn boat... 

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. AINSLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Ainsley is sitting at her desk with a fan blowing. Someone knocks on the door.

DONNA 
Hello? 

AINSLEY 
Is that C.J.? 

DONNA 
[opening door] No, it's Donna Moss. 

AINSLEY 
Hi. 

DONNA 
[looks around the office] What happened? 

AINSLEY 
I cant't turn the heat down. 

DONNA 
Did you try? 

AINSLEY
No. I just looked at the thermostat and got frustrated. 

DONNA 
[in disbelief] Really. 

AINSLEY 
Of course, I tried! I could grow papayas in here. 

DONNA 
It's a nice office. 

AINSLEY 
It's the steam pipe distribution venue. 

DONNA 
It's got character. 

AINSLEY 
I think I'm losing weight. 

DONNA 
Wanna come work upstairs in the bullpen? 

AINSLEY 
I need to concentrate. 

DONNA 
Nobody's here. 

AINSLEY 
No, I'm fine. 

DONNA 
Okay. I just came down to say hi. 

AINSLEY 
And I'd talk but I just... I need to get this done. 

DONNA 
I'll leave you alone. 

AINSLEY 
Thanks. 

DONNA 
What are you working on? 

AINSLEY 
I'm making notes for Josh. 

DONNA 
Ah. [sits down] 

AINSLEY 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
Interesting. 

AINSLEY 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
The Constitutional questions involved. 

AINSLEY 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
Full faith and credit. 

AINSLEY 
[looks up from her computer] Right. 

DONNA 
[pauses] Do you and I look alike? 

AINSLEY 
I'm sorry? 

DONNA 
Do we look alike? 

AINSLEY 
No. 

DONNA 
That's what I thought. I didn't think we looked alike. 

AINSLEY 
Yeah. 

DONNA 
Have you ever thought about dying your hair red? 

AINSLEY 
No. 

DONNA 
You should. 

AINSLEY 
Why? 

DONNA 
It'd look good. 

AINSLEY 
We don't look alike. 

DONNA 
No, and I tell people that. [pause] I'm going to work upstairs. [stands] 

AINSLEY 
I'll see you tomorrow. 

DONNA 
I think it's because of the alabaster skin and the farm girl looks that... 

AINSLEY 
You're wigging out, Donna. 

DONNA 
Yes. Are you sure you don't want to work upstairs? 

AINSLEY 
No. It may be hot down here but at least it's quiet. 

The pipes make a loud banging sound, startling Ainsley.

AINSLEY
Okay. 

She shuts her computer notebook and stands.

AINSLEY
Boy, I could use a Fresca. 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh and Skinner are talking. 

JOSH 
You're going to quote the bible to me? 

SKINNER 
I didn't... 

JOSH 
Really? 

SKINNER 
My point was hat the founders based the country on Judeo-Christian morality... 

JOSH 
[pacing] Matt... 

SKINNER 
...and that the biblical concept of marriage maybe can't be separated from the law quite 
as easily as you'd like. 

JOSH 
The founding fathers made it very clear that they didn't want Judeo-Christian morality 
within 10 city blocks of the law. Matt! [pause] 

SKINNER 
What? 

Josh pauses, looking at Skinner.

SKINNER
What? 

JOSH 
Nothing. [sits] You understand that gay partners will be permanently ineligable for 
survivor benefits, Medicare, Medicaid.... 

SKINNER 
Which the government can't afford to pay anyway. 

JOSH 
So we caught a break there. [sighs] 

SKINNER 
It's getting pretty late. 

JOSH 
I had more notes. 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
C.J. is walking down the hallway. 

C.J. 
Carol? 

CAROL
Yeah? 

C.J. 
Did you get the old drafts back? 

CAROL
Of the education speech? 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

CAROL
Yeah. 

C.J. nods and turns to walk back down the hall.

CAROL
Except Danny's. 

C.J. 
[turns back toward Carol] Excuse me? 

CAROL
Danny wanted to keep his. 

C.J. 
Excuse me. 

She storms past Carol into the reporters' area and stands in front of Danny.

C.J.
What's the problem? 

DANNY
[looks up at her from his seat] How ya doing? 

C.J. 
What's the problem, Danny? 

DANNY
C.J., there's no earthly reason why I should give you that draft back and you know it. 
You can't even believe you're asking me for it. So unless you're going to give me a hot 
towel and some chocolate chip cookies, you better... 

C.J. 
Everybody else gave it back, Danny. 

DANNY
Then everybody else can read my paper tomorrow. 

C.J. 
[looks up and addresses all the reporters] I'm guaranteeing you all no substantive 
changes, no new policy initiatives. 

DANNY
You don't have to guarantee me anything. I've got the old draft right here. 

C.J. 
[leans over and stage whispers to Danny] I certainly hope we don't accidentally send 
your luggage to Belgium on the way back. [walks away] 

DANNY
[raising his voice] Yeah, I wouldn't want to find out what it's like to be inconvenianced 
by the White House! 

C.J. stops at the doorway and turns to speak to a reporter in the front.

C.J.
It was the budget meeting, by the way. 

STEVE
What's that? 

C.J. 
The reason we took off late. It was the budget meeting. Although there's something to be 
said for... [pause] something to be said for... 

REPORTER
Something to be said for what? 

C.J. 
Nothing. 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
In the staff cabin, Toby, Bartlet, and Sam are working on the education speech. 
Charlie is sitting in a chair writing. 

TOBY 
[reading from speech] "I was raised to appreciate the value of teachers and teaching. 
My grandmother, who began her teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse..."

BARTLET 
Actually, it was two rooms. 

TOBY 
Okay. 

BARTLET 
Italian stonecutters were paying her to teach their kids English in the basement of the 
rectory. They put up a wall and made it two rooms as a thank you gift. 

TOBY 
We'll change it to two rooms. 

BARTLET 
I haven't heard the big idea yet. 

TOBY 
Sir, the speech is in pretty good shape. 

BARTLET 
Yeah. [reads from speech] "As you know, I began my campaign...'' [looks at Toby] What 
happened to 100,000 new teachers? 

TOBY 
Sir? 

BARTLET 
No money? 

TOBY 
No teachers. 

BARTLET 
Toby! 

TOBY 
There aren't a 100,000 new teachers. We can't make people be teachers. 

BARTLET 
We can give incentives. 

TOBY 
In certain public districts there are tax incentives... 

BARTLET 
Well, it's not doing the trick. 

TOBY 
No. No. I know. But for right now... 

SAM 
[looking at what Charlie is writing] What's that mean? 

CHARLIE 
I'm sorry? 

SAM 
What does that mean? 

CHARLIE 
I was just scribbling. 

SAM 
You wrote down, "Send them to college." 

CHARLIE 
[sounding scared] I was just scribbling. 

SAM 
What did you mean when you wrote down, "send them to college"? 

CHARLIE 
No, 'cause it's like circling horses in the paper but not making the bet. 

BARTLET 
[stands and walks toward Charlie] Tuition incentives. 

TOBY 
Mr. President... 

BARTLET 
Talk, Charlie. 

CHARLIE 
Mr. President, if this was an idea, somebody would have had it already. 

BARTLET 
I find fault with that formula. 

CHARLIE 
Well... 

BARTLET 
What? 

CHARLIE 
The government will send you to college or law school or medical school if you spend 
three years in the armed forces. Why not... 

SAM 
[pacing] College tuition to anyone who wants to go college in exchange for they teach 
in a public school where we send'em for three years. 

BARTLET 
Why can't that idea be floated? 

TOBY 
Anybody know how we pay for it? 

BARTLET 
That comes later. 

TOBY 
Yes, it does come next, so for the moment why don't we... 

BARTLET 
Kick this around. 

TOBY 
Mr. President... 

BARTLET 
[walks to the door] I'll be in my study. It's an incredible sky tonight. 

PILOT [via P.A.] 
Ladies and gentleman, this is Colonel Beach from the flight deck. We've been told there's 
choppy wind ahead and we've been cleared to climb to 42,000 feet.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

SKINNER [VO] 
57% of the people... 

JOSH [VO] 
I know what 57% of the people say. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Josh and Skinner are walking down the hallway. 

JOSH
58% of the people say that gay spouses should receive health benefits and 54% say Social 
Security benefits and by the way we haven't talked about the 14th amendment. 

SKINNER
Uh, Josh, the 14th amend... 

JOSH
I think a strict interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause would dictate that 
homophobia can't be made into a law. 

SKINNER
That's for the court to decide; but I think they'll uphold it. 

They enter JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh stands behind his desk facing Skinner.

JOSH
Lawrence Tribe disagrees with you. 

SKINNER
Lawrence Tribe doesn't sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. 

JOSH
Five Justices! 

SKINNER
Josh, I came here as a friend. I think you know that. 

JOSH
What does that have to do with it? 

SKINNER
I came here 'cause I came here. Look. This is gonna be a law whether the President 
vetoes it or not. They have the votes in the Senate to override it. 

JOSH
The Senate's not in session. The President could stick this in his pants pocket and 
it's vetoed. 

SKINNER
And it will come back in January and you will have to live through this twice. And you 
will lose both times. 

JOSH
Matt! 

SKINNER
Ask me the question. 

JOSH
He compared homosexuality to kleptomania and sex addition, Matt. 

SKINNER
Yes. 

JOSH
The Majority Leader. The leader of your own party. 

SKINNER
He was wrong and I told him so. 

JOSH
For cryin' out loud! 

SKINNER
Ask me the question, Josh! 

JOSH
How can you be a member of this party?!? 

SKINNER
You've been holding that in for way too long, man. 

JOSH
This party who says that who you are is against the law. 

SKINNER
You know, I never understand why you gun control people don't all join the N.R.A. They've 
got two million members. You bring three million to the next meeting... call a vote... 
All those in favor of tossing guns - [Snaps fingers] - Bam! Move on. 

JOSH
That's a heck of a strategy, Matt. I'll bring that up in a meeting. 

Josh sighs heavily as he collapses into his chair. 

SKINNER
I agree with 95% of the Republican platform. I believe in local government. I'm in favor 
of individual rights rather than group rights. I believe free markets lead to free people 
and that the country needs a strong national defense. My life doesn't have to be about 
being a homosexual. It doesn't have to be entirely about that. 

Josh looks at Skinner thoughtfully before deciding not to continue. 

JOSH
Thanks for coming by. 

SKINNER
Thanks for the beer. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Two men are waiting on Skinner. One sits while the other paces. Skinner walks up.

MAN 1
Oh... there he is. [to Skinner] How'd it go? 

SKINNER
He'll sign it. 

Josh observes the congressmen from his doorway. 

MAN 1
Ooo hoo! I can tell McDougal? 

SKINNER
[puts on his coat] Yeah. 

As they head for the exit, one of them claps Skinner's shoulder. His hand lingers there. 

MAN 1
Good job, Congressman! 

SKINNER
Take your hand off my shoulder, Congressman. 

The camera lingers on a conflicted Josh watching the exiting congressmen.

Toby sits behind a desk and Sam paces in front of the desk. 

TOBY
The speech is fine now. 

SAM
Toby. 

TOBY
Speech is fine. 

SAM
100,000 college scholarships... 

TOBY
It's an overly simplistic... 

SAM
Toby... 

C.J. opens the office door which cuts Toby and Sam short. 

C.J.
You wanted me? 

SAM
You should tip the press off we might float an education initiative. 

C.J.
[confused] But, I just told them... 

TOBY
We're not floating. 

SAM
We might float, I'm sayin' and you should give them a heads up. 

C.J.
Excuse me. I need to go look like an idiot. 

C.J. leaves closing the office door behind her. 

TOBY
We're not floating a policy initiative, Sam. I don't care if it's a trip to the moon on 
gossamer wings. 

SAM
Look... 

TOBY
It's pie in the sky to say nothing of patronizing to have privileged Ivy Leaguers play 
teacher to America's most vulnerable children. 

SAM
The people taking advantage of this aren't going to be over-privileged. 

TOBY
How do you suppose the teacher's union will feel about it? 

SAM
They'll have 100,000 new members. 

TOBY
All of whom will leave after three years. 

SAM
Most of whom... 

TOBY
And the kids will be abandoned as well. 

SAM
They won't be abandoned. 

TOBY
Their teachers will leave! 

SAM
Once you're in fifth grade what do you care what your fourth grade teacher is doing? 

TOBY
Sam. 

SAM
Toby, these people are gonna be role models, to kids that don't have much contact with 
young, successful, college graduates many of whom will have grown up in neighborhoods 
just like theirs. 

TOBY
Sam. 

SAM
Toby, we could have... 

TOBY
Sam! Where are we getting the money? [pauses to reign in his temper] 
Where are we getting the money? 

SAM
I was really mortified that I froze up on that speech. 

TOBY
Yeah. [pause] You should've told me a few days ago. 

SAM
Yeah. 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Ainsley sits at a desk typing and Donna sits on the desk talking. 

DONNA
I played the flute. I'm a flutist. In high school I was the best in my row. And, so I 
ask myself, if I pursued the flute professionally, would I be meeting interesting men? 
And the answer comes back to me. Probably not. 

AINSLEY
I played the trombone. 

DONNA
Did you meet interesting men? 

AINSLEY
Yeah. 

DONNA
Is, is it a hard instrument to learn? If I took it up now... 

Josh walks up and interrupts Donna who hops up off the desk and exits. 

JOSH
Talk to me about the Full Faith and Credit Clause. 

AINSLEY
It says that full faith and credit shall be given by each state to the public acts, 
records, and judicial proceedings of every other state - it means if you're married 
in Maryland it's got to be recognized by Nebraska. 

JOSH
So, how is the Marriage Recognition Act not unconstitutional? 

AINSLEY
'Cause it also says that Congress can proscribe the manner in which such acts and records 
are proved - which means they can decide what being married means within the context of 
Article IV. 

Donna is behind the glass partition in the bullpen and has answered a phone. 

DONNA
Josh. 

JOSH
Yeah? 

DONNA 
[pointing to phone sitting in cradle] Toby. 

Josh walks around the glass partition and picks up the phone.

JOSH
Yeah? 

TOBY
What's goin' on? 

JOSH
I'm going to tell him to sign the damn thing. 

TOBY
Okay. 

JOSH
How's his mood? 

TOBY
He's frustrated. He's feeling... 

JOSH
You know when he goes off on a thing Toby, he expects you to bring him in. He wants you 
to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself. 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
Josh, off the top of your head, what do you think about tuition incentives for... 

Toby stops mid-question as he hears an announcement on the PA begin. 

PILOT [via P.A.]
Ladies and gentlemen, from the flight deck. We're 82 miles south of the runway and 
beginning our descent. We'd like to ask you all to find a seat. Thank you. 

JOSH
What was that? 

TOBY
We're landing. 

JOSH
No, I mean, what were you going to...

TOBY
Nothing. 

JOSH
All right. I'll talk to you later. 

Josh and Donna begin making their way out of the bullpen past Ainsley. Josh walks a pace 
in front of Donna. 

JOSH
I'm gonna talk to Leo. 

AINSLEY
I'll see you guys Monday. 

DONNA
Good night. 

JOSH
Take it easy. 

Josh and Donna continue walking down the HALLWAY.

DONNA
Did you know she plays the trombone? 

JOSH
I didn't. 

DONNA
Tonight stunk, Josh. 

JOSH
I'm sorry about that. 

DONNA
I didn't mean having to work, although that was a treat. I meant the guy. 

JOSH
Who was he? 

DONNA
A lobbyist with Travis West. He was pretty full of himself and without a lot of cause 
to be. 

JOSH
An obnoxious insurance lobbyist? What were the odds? 

DONNA
That isn't funny, Josh. 

JOSH
I gotta go see Leo. 

Josh turns and continues walking down the hallway as Donna veers off to start heading 
for the exit. 

DONNA
I'll call you in the morning. 

Josh stops walking and turns back towards Donna. 

JOSH
You look really great in that dress tonight, Donna. You should buy it for yourself. 

Josh smiles at Donna and again turns to walk towards Leo's office. Donna smiles as she 
watches Josh walk away before exiting herself.
 
CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo sits on his couch with a phone sitting next to him. 

BARTLET
[on speakerphone] Yeah? 

Leo doesn't answer immediately. Bartlet repeats himself less patiently. 

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
We hold the ship in Bahrain. 

BARTLET
It doesn't do anything to hold the ship in Bahrain 

LEO
Sir, we hold the ship in Bahrain and then send a sample of the oil to the U.S. customs 
lab in San Francisco. If the point of origin violates sanctions...

	BONNEVILLE-3 LANDING ROUTE
	PORTLAND, OREGON

Bartlet is standing talking on the phone. 

BARTLET
Yeah. You know what's going to happen? They'll sell off the cargo in a friendly port. 
780,000 metric tons of gas oil against a two million dollar fine for the oil company. 

LEO
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Which their profits from the sale will more than cover. We're not providing much of a 
disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions. 

Josh enters LEO'S OFFICE and takes a seat in the chair near Leo.

LEO
What else is there to do? 

BARTLET
If we're going to have sanctions at all, I think we should make them stick. I think 
that we should confiscate the cargo, seize the ship, sell the oil and use the money 
to beef up anti-smuggling operations. 

LEO
You don't mean tonight. You mean in the future... 

Bartlet sighs heavily in resignation. C.J. enters the room. 

C.J.
We're landing, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
[to Leo] Yeah. In the future. 

LEO
Okay. Josh wants to talk about the... 

BARTLET 
[to Leo] Hang on. [to C.J.] You need me? 

C.J.
I can wait. 

BARTLET 
[into phone] Yeah. 

JOSH
The Marriage Recognition Act. 

BARTLET
[sighs] Yeah. 

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, PRESS AREA - NIGHT
C.J. approaches the front of the Press Area facing the reporters. As C.J. begins to 
speak, Toby approaches and stands near C.J.. 

C.J.
Folks, we'll be landing in just a few minutes. Follow the blue signs to your bus. 
Oh, one thing before we land, when I said before that there'd be absolutely no policy 
shifts or new initiatives in the education speech tomorrow... That was correct, except 
it's possible there might be a policy shift or new initiative in the education speech 
tomorrow. 

The reporters groan and grumble. 

TOBY
There isn't going to be a change. 

REPORTER
Toby! 

TOBY
There isn't going to be a change! [to C.J.] Danny? 

C.J.
He's not going to give it back. 

Toby heaves a sigh and walk over to Danny then sits in the seat beside him. 

TOBY
Danny, Sam choked hard on the last draft and wants to burn it. 

Danny pauses a couple of seconds to think it over. 

DANNY
No problem. 

C.J.
[incredulous] No problem? 

DANNY 
[to Toby] Tell him to relax. He'll get his swing back. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

Toby stands and begins to walk away. 

DANNY
Tell him I didn't read it. 

TOBY
[smiling slightly] Thanks. 

Toby exits with the draft in hand. 

C.J.
You were just having a little go at me, weren't you? 

DANNY
Yeah. It's a long flight. 

C.J.
So you decided to kill time by... 

DANNY
Yeah. You know why? 

C.J.
Tell me you went to Notre Dame. 

DANNY
Maybe next time you won't be so quick to mock on the eve of a Michigan game. 

C.J. frowns at Danny a moment before turning and walking towards the front of the plane 
away from the Press Area. 

C.J. 
[to herself] There must be an escape hatch here of some kind.

BARTLET
I don't care about the constitutional argument. It's gay bashing. It's legislative gay 
bashing. How do I put my name on it? 

JOSH
I wouldn't, sir. I'd put it away. 

BARTLET
Pocket veto's a politician's way out. 

JOSH
They'll send the bill again when they're in session. Meanwhile, we focus on the 
Employment Non-discrimination Act. 

BARTLET
If I'm going to sign it in January, why am I vetoing it now? 

JOSH
As a symbolic gesture to the gay community. 

BARTLET
I'm sure the gay community can't wait to thank me. 

LEO
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
This is just wrong. 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
[getting worked up] You can look at the policy numbers and Article IV and Social Security 
benefits. It doesn't matter. It's just wrong. We shouldn't be defining love and we 
certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it. It's wrong. This is the job for... This is the 
job of somebody else. 

LEO
Well, right now it's ours. 

BARTLET
It's wrong. 

LEO
Sir. 

BARTLET
I should get out a rubber stamp that says 'Josiah Bartlet votes no.' 

JOSH
That's just what the conservatives are hoping you'll do. 

BARTLET
I should get out a rubber stamp! 

Bartlet heaves an exasperated sigh. 

LEO
Sir. 

BARTLET
Put it in a drawer. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

JOSH
Thank you, Mr. President. 

LEO
We'll talk at the hotel. [hangs up]

Leo and Josh sit quietly a second. 

JOSH
Okay. 

LEO
All right. 

JOSH
Have a good night. 

LEO
You too. 

JOSH
Hey Leo, Margaret mentioned... 

LEO
Oh, come on Josh! 

JOSH
No, she just said... 

LEO
My divorce papers came today. She thinks I'm going to drink. 

JOSH
It seems like a pretty good reason to. 

LEO
I'm an alcoholic, I don't need a good reason to. 

JOSH
You wanna have coffee someplace? 

LEO
I wanna go home. 

JOSH
Okay. 

LEO
I'll see you on Monday. 

Josh exits. Leo grabs his coat and scarf and starts putting them on. 

LEO 
[calls] Margaret, I'm going. 

Margaret stops what she's doing and walks into Leo's office. 

MARGARET 
[with a resigned tone, yet worried expression] Okay. 

Leo looks at Margaret for a moment. 

LEO 
[quietly] You're a good girl. 

Leo turns and leaves, closing his office door behind him as Margaret watches. 

MARGARET 
[pacified] Okay. 

Margaret closes the door between her office and Leo's as she steps back into her 
own office are

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT'S CABIN - NIGHT
Bartlet is sitting in a chair reading something as C.J. enters. 

C.J.
Sir? 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

C.J.
You're off the phone? 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

C.J. crosses room and sits on bench next to Bartlet. 

BARTLET
There was a question? 

C.J.
For a sidebar, on the game tomorrow. 

She indicates the hat to show she means the Notre Dame game. 

C.J.
Why did you go to Notre Dame? 

BARTLET
Why not? 

C.J.
Bearing in mind that I'm just repeating someone else's question. You were accepted at 
Harvard, Yale, and Williams. Why did you go to Notre Dame? 

BARTLET
Because I was thinking about becoming a priest. 

C.J.
Really? 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

C.J.
What happened? 

BARTLET
I met Abbey. 

C.J.
[obviously touched] Why don't you ever give me answers like that when we're running 
for something? 

BARTLET
Because I like to bother you. 

C.J.
Well, I shall not be defeated. 

BARTLET
Sit down. 

C.J.
Okay. [sits] 

Toby enters the office carrying a folder. He extracts some pages and hands them to 
Bartlet. 

TOBY
Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Toby. 

TOBY
Here's the final draft. 

BARTLET
Toby, you should sit down. We're landing in one minute and ten seconds. 

TOBY
How do you know that? 

BARTLET
I set my watch to the cockpit computer. You should sit down. 

TOBY
Thank you. 

BARTLET
Do you know why the Assistant Energy Secretary is on the plane? 

TOBY
You have a meeting with him on the way back. 

BARTLET
That's right. 

TOBY
I think Charlie's idea was a good one. I think you should ask Leo to put together a team 
to study the feasibility of appropriations for a pilot program with 100 teachers. 

BARTLET
They're taking the tanker to Bahrain and then the company's going to make a profit. 

TOBY
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
The Marriage Recognition Act is going to be law. 

In the background we hear the landing gear go down... 

TOBY
Yeah. 

BARTLET
100 new teachers? 

TOBY
Yeah. 

BARTLET
Instead of 100,000. 

TOBY
Yeah. 

BARTLET
Well, it's a start I guess. 

We hear the screech of the airplane's wheels touching down. 

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
