TEASER 

FADE IN: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE 

	THURSDAY
	THREE DAYS BEFORE INAUGURATION

We are in Toby's office looking through the window at Will in his office typing on his 
computer. Toby throws a ball up against the window, and Will comes into Toby's office.

WILL
You're not ever worried about the window breaking?

TOBY
During moments of peak frustration. When the Speaker of the House threatens to repeal 
the 16th Amendment. A couple of Yankee games. And there was the time Congress censured 
my boss. But it's always held up, that window. That window's a game-day player.

WILL
What do you need?

TOBY
Leo was just in here. [closes the door] What did you say to the President last night?

WILL
The President came to my office. He just dropped in.

TOBY
I know. What did you say?

WILL
His speech transcript was right on top. He read it.

TOBY
What did you say?

WILL
He said, "Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?" And I said, 
"I dont know, sir, but it is."

TOBY
Didn't we talk about this?

WILL
Yes.

TOBY
But you gave it a shot anyway?

WILL
I wasn't giving it a shot, Toby, it was a casual conversation.

TOBY
With the President?

WILL
He came here. He was standing in my doorway.

TOBY
The Dow plummets because of casual conversations with this man, but that's not the point.

WILL
What's the point?

TOBY
You can't get in his head this close to something this important. You've got to keep 
the train on the tracks.

WILL
I apologize, but there's...

TOBY
No, no "but" at the end of that. Not on this one. This one haunts him. It haunts everyone.

WILL
Well, I finished the language.

TOBY
How is it?

WILL
Bloodless, compromising and half a loaf.

TOBY
That's foreign policy.

They exit Toby's office and enter WILL'S OFFICE. Will clears his throat and begins to 
read what he's written.

WILL
"America stands today as the one truly indispensaple nation-- the strongest force and 
the proudest voice for peace, pluralism and prosperity that the world has ever known."

TOBY
Okay, keep the ancient Romans out of the first ten rows, and we're fine.

WILL
"Today at the dawn of a new century, America needs a new commitment to protect our own 
security, to model freedom to the world."

TOBY
To model it?

WILL
I figure if we're not going to help create freedom from tyranny, then let's at least 
sell some BarcaLoungers.

TOBY
The U.S. doesn't help create freedom from tyranny?

WILL
I forget to add, "where our own interests aren't necesssarly involved." [reading speech] 
"To do what we can to fulfill humanity's promise and to prove that self-determination is 
the watchword of all mankind."

TOBY
The watchword of all mankind? I don't know what the means.

WILL
Don't worry, neither will anyone else.

TOBY
The speech is good. It's better than good. There's one paragraph that's vague, and we're 
going to live with it. 

Toby starts to walk out.

WILL
Which is more than you can say for the Kundunese.

TOBY
I'll be in my office.

Toby walks out and Will starts to talk. Toby comes back.

WILL
I heard once-- I don't know if this is true-- I heard once that you convinced the 
President to let you rewrite a section of the State of the Union with less than 24 
hours to go. It was the second year, and everybody was a Republican whether they were 
or not, and people at the DNC convinced him to include the line, "The era of big 
government is over," and you couldn't live with it. Because government should be a 
place where people come to gather, and no one gets left behind. An instrument of good. 
And that's exactly what we heard in the State of the Union the next night.

TOBY
There were maybe four people in the room when I had that conversation.

WILL
Well, if I'd had been one of them, I'd have repeated it to everyone I met. Anyway, I'm 
going to move on to some language in trade and commerce.

TOBY
Okay.

Toby walks out of Will's office and back into his.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM  - NIGHT

	FRIDAY NIGHT

REPORTER JOHN 
I'm sorry, was Nigeria in that meeting?

C.J.
Ghana, Nigeria, and what did I say?

REPORTER JOHN
Zaire.

C.J.
Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire. The Arkutu meet with representatives from those countries. 
They met for three hours, and we're told the talks were amicable but that no progress 
was made. Steve?

REPORTER STEVE
C.J., there's a 1948 U.N. Convention on Genocide, and the U.S. is a signatory. Simply 
put, it says that if it's determined that genocide is taking place, the United States 
is compeled to intervene.

C.J.
The problem is the Convention distinguishes between acts of genocide and genocide.

REPORTER KATIE
It distinguishes between acts of genocide and genocide?

C.J.
It does. Mark?

REPORTER MARK
How many acts of genocide constitute a genocide?

C.J.
I don't know. Danny?

DANNY
What's the weather report for Sunday?

C.J.
Two below with the wind chill. That's a full lid. Good night.

REPORTERS
C.J., thank you. Good night, C.J.

DANNY
Two below, that's beach weather for the President.

C.J.
Yes.

C.J. and Danny walk to the HALLWAY.

DANNY 
So, what is the distinction?

C.J.
Danny, I have no idea. I have no idea what the distinction is. All I know is I got a memo 
from State-- close your notebook-- a memo from State to make sure not to call it genocide. 

DANNY
I want to talk to you about something.

C.J.
No, we're not going to do that anymore. We're not going to talk about Shareef.

DANNY
This isn't about Shareef.

C.J.
Okay, then what?

DANNY
It's a little about Shareef.

C.J.
Good day to you, sir.

DANNY
C.J.

C.J.
I said, good day, sir.

DANNY
Get in there, would you?

C.J.
Nobody takes me seriously when I say "good day, sir."

DANNY
Get in there.

They go inside C.J.'S OFFICE.

C.J.
Did you find the pilot?

DANNY
Shareef's pilot?

C.J.
I can't remember his name.

DANNY
Jamil Bari?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
Yes, I did. He went to Augsbury Aviation in Bulgaria. He's survived by his wife, Marita, 
and his two children.

C.J.
You don't even want to say you were wrong and apologize for your superior attitude lately.

DANNY
I do. First I want to tell you this.

C.J.
Rifts at the Pentagon.

DANNY
Jets and the Sharks. I talked to an officer who works in U.S. foreign intelligence 
activities there, who believes that Miles Hutchinson is the Commander-in-Chief. And in 
the course of the discussion he told me, the President had rescinded Executive Orders 
11905 and 12333.

C.J.
The President hasn't rescinded any Executive Orders.

DANNY
Well, not publicly. This was an incredibly clumsy attempt on the part of this officer 
to send a turf message to the President, and obviously he's not a rogue, so I thought 
I'd give you the heads-up.

C.J.
Tha President appreciates it, and it's not like it's anything new. I don't know who the 
Jets are and who the Sharks are, but it's Fitzwallace and Hutchinson.

DANNY
That's pretty much what I'm writing. Who here can a researcher talk to about Pentagon 
employees who are detailed to the White House?

C.J.
Josh's office. You can get it from Donna.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
Hey, what are Executive Orders 11...?

DANNY
11905 and 12333?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
Making it illegal to assassinate a foreign leader. I told you it was a little about 
Shareef.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Will, Toby and Josh are going over the final polishing of the speech.

TOBY
All right, last looks.

JOSH
C.J. says there are three references to "mankind." Can we make it "humankind"?

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
Foreign Relations would like "war" changed to "war and strife".

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
Where we say, "tens of billions wasted," the OMB would like us to say, "billions and 
billions wasted."

TOBY
No.

JOSH
Then that's all for me.

TOBY
[to Will] Got those?

WILL
Yeah.

TOBY
All right. Let's leave the building. What do you say?

JOSH
Anyone playing at Iota tonight?

TOBY
I don't know. Let's just go. Ask C.J.

JOSH
[to Will] There's that club called Iota in Arlington. They usually have some good people. 
You want to come out?

WILL
I appreciate that. I should stay here and put in the changes.

JOSH
Ginger or Bonnie will do that.

WILL
Yeah, but there are going to be notes, and I should probably be sharp tomorrow.

JOSH
Okay.

Will goes back to his office.

TOBY
He's frustated with the foreign polciy section. He wanted to change it.

JOSH
The language?

TOBY
No. U.S. foreign policy. Hang on. Will?

Will comes back.

WILL
Yeah?

JOSH
Listen, the President takes seriously the question of whether or not to risk American blood.

WILL
I'm sure he does.

JOSH
He can't just send people someplace.

WILL
I understand. Is that it?

TOBY
No. "Do what we can to fulfill humanity's promise."

WILL
You're kidding me now.

TOBY
No. Leadership wants to cut it.

WILL
Okay. Where does the President's Catholicism distinguishes between American blood and 
other kinds of blood?

JOSH
It doesn't. The voters do. The voters that you champion and that I can't stand.

WILL
Yeah. I'm going to put these changes in.

Will exits to his office.

JOSH
What's his level of frustration?

TOBY
It's high.

JOSH
He's here on a temp job. He's that invested in...? 

CRASH! The window between Toby and Will's office shatters because Will, trying to be 
like Toby, has thrown a ball at it.

JOSH
This never happened before, has it?

TOBY
No. No, it hasn't.

WILL
Sorry.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

BARTLET
Charlie, I'm going to change my mind again on te Bible.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, you have to imagine my utter surprise.

BARTLET
Aren't you afraid that one day I'm just going to kick your ass like it's never been 
kicked?

CHARLIE
What Bible would you prefer, sir?

BARTLET
Let's go with the Washington Bible.

CHARLIE
Well, as I said, that might be problematic to get by Sunday.

BARTLET
Just put it on a plane.

CHARLIE
The Freemasons won't let it travel by plane.

BARTLET
What do the Freemasons have to do with it?

CHARLIE
The New York Freemasons have the Bible Washington was sworn in on. It can't travel on a 
plane 'cause the altitude does... something.

BARTLET
Take a train.

CHARLIE
They have a rule that when the Bible travels three Freemasons have to go with it.

BARTLET
Buy three tickets.

CHARLIE
Well, it's four, 'cause you need one for the Bible, but the larger problem is...

BARTLET
Are you trying to tell me that Freemasons don't like me?

CHARLIE
Not a huge demo for you, no. But they're good people, and after all, a President is 
being inaugurated, so let's see what we can do.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CHARLIE
Good night, Mr. President.

Bartlet exits onto the PORTICO where he runs into Leo walking out of the Outer Office.

LEO
Hey.

BARTLET
I saw C.J. smiling before. Has something good happened?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
You didn't rescind two Executive Orders.

BARTLET
I didn't?

LEO
It was an NSC Presidential Decision Directive-- it's different.

BARTLET
It's not different.

LEO
It is, and that's how I was able to look C.J. in the eye and say you didn't rescind 
11905, and that's how she was able to look Danny Concannon in the eye and do the same.

BARTLET
Well, then it was a dodged bullet.

LEO
No, sir, we didn't dodge nothing. They hit what they aimed at.

BARTLET
Leo, come on...

LEO
It was a shot across the bow, it was. This guy giving it to Danny.

BARTLET
You're being paranoid.

LEO
And you're being unbelievabley naive, sir.

BARTLET
You think in your wildest dreams that Hutchinson's running an offense? He's that pissed 
that I asked for forced Depletion Report he's going to show me in Danny's byline I go to 
Khundu and here's what happened in Bermuda?

LEO
I do. In my wildest dreams, I do.

BARTLET
[sighs] Abbey's already gone to bed. I should get up there.

LEO
Hey, the Chief Justice wrote another opinion in verse. Want to hear it?

BARTLET
No. [starts to walk off]

LEO
[to Bartlet walking away.] "I say this denial is not fit for trial."

BARTLET
[yells back] Good night.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT
Bartlet walks in and puts his breifcase down. He notices Abbey has fallen asleep in a 
chair while reading a book. He walks over to her.

BARTLET
Abbey. 

No response.

BARTLET
Abigail. 

No response.

BARTLET
Abbey, the kids are eating sugar. 

She wakes up.

ABBEY
Oh.

BARTLET
How you doing? You know I gave the kids candy all the time, right?

ABBEY
Behind my back?

BARTLET
Yes.

ABBEY
You bought their love.

BARTLET
Well, it was for sale, and I wanted it.

ABBEY
Come to bed.

BARTLET
I'm going to stay up for a bit and read and watch some news.

ABBEY
Okay. Tony's grandkids are in there watching a movie. It may still be in there. I think 
he has a... Laurel and Hardy movie.

BARTLET
His grandkids were in here?

ABBEY
For a while. We had to move them because.... What do you care right now?

BARTLET
I don't.

ABBEY
Come to bed soon.

BARTLET
For the record...

ABBEY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Frederick the Great told his generals... to defend everything is to defend nothing.

ABBEY
And?

BARTLET
I don't really know what that means, do you?

ABBEY
No. But I'm mostly asleep right now, and also I don't know what you're talking about.

BARTLET
Well, that makes two of us.

ABBEY
Who made you crazy? Not that someone has to make you that way.

BARTLET
I'll be in soon.

ABBEY
You gave the girls candy?

BARTLET
I was their dealer. Live with it.

ABBEY
Come to bed. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. CLUB IOTA - NIGHT
C.J., Toby and Josh are sitting down at a table. Jill Sobule is on stage performing 
"Heroes."

JILL SOBULE 
"Why are all our heroes so imperfect?
Why do they always bring me down?"

C.J.
[to waiter] Tank and tonic.

JOSH
Uh, two. Cynthia, I left a message for Donna. She might call.

WAITER CYNTHIA 
Sure.

JILL 
"The statue in the park has lost his crown. 
William Faulkner, drunk..."

C.J.
The guy across the street is beating up a pregnant woman. You don't go over and try 
and stop it?

TOBY
Guy across the street is beating up anybody, I like to think I go over and try to stop 
it, but we're not talking about the President going to Asia or the President going to 
Rwanda or the President going to Qumar. We're talking about the Preisdent sending other 
people's kids to do that.

C.J.
That's always what we're talking about, and in addition to being somebody's kids, 
they're soldiers and sailors, and if we're about freedom from tyranny, then we're about 
freedom from tyranny, and if we're not, we should shut up.

JOSH
Yes.

TOBY
Back at the office, you were telling Will...

C.J.
He said that to Will 'cause that's what we say.

TOBY
You were't even there.

C.J.
It's what we always say.

TOBY
On Sunday, he's taking an oath to ensure domestic tranquilty.

C.J.
And to establish justice and promote the general welfare. Stand by while atrocities are 
taking place, and you're an accomplice.

TOBY
I'm not indifferent to that, but knuckleheaded self-destruction is never going to burn 
itself out, you really want to send your kids across the street into the fire?

C.J.
Want to? No. Should I? Yes.

TOBY
Why? And don't give me a lefty answer.

C.J.
A lefty answer is all I've got.

TOBY
Why are you sending your kids across the street?

JILL 
"William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, 
Tennesse Wiiliams, drunk and depressed..."

C.J.
'Cause those are somebody's kids, too.

He mutes that TV and turns on a another TV that is giving weather report on Washington. 
He mutes that TV and turns on a fourth TV and presses play on the VCR.

"You know what?"
"What?"
"The wooden soldiers."

Bartlet leans closer to the TV and watches as the wooden soldiers begin to march. 
He glances up at the first TV which is showing real soldiers marching. He keeps 
looking back and forth between the two TV's showing the real and wooden soldiers, 
then he picks up the phone and presses a button.

Josh and Toby are sitting at table talking. Jlll Sobule is on stage performing "Rock 
me to Sleep."

JILL
"Rock me to sleep, Rock me to sleep, 
I wish I had somebody to rock me to sleep."

JOSH
I'm not talking about fighting two wars at once, I'm not talking about fighting wars. 
Intervening when there's violence against people who are defenseless...

TOBY
Fine, but if we go here, then that means they can go there, and look, there's more 
injustice over there.

JOSH
We elect these people. And not for nothing, but if'd had been the world's policemen 
in the 30's, you and I...

TOBY
We would have had a lot more relatives.

JOSH
That's right.

JILL
"Of the sycamore tree..."

JOSH
Where the hell is Donna?

TOBY
Leave her alone-- she's having a last night with... What's his name?

JOSH
I called her at Jack's, and I paged her.

TOBY
Leave her alone.

C.J. comes running back to the table.

C.J.
I've got to bo back to the office.

JOSH
What happened?

C.J.
[putting on her coat] Danny screwed me, and somebody on one of our staffs screwed the 
rest of us.

C.J. walks off. Josh and Toby's cellphones and pagers begin to go off.

TOBY
I'll get the call. [to phone] This is Toby.

CHARLIE
[on phone] You got to come in. It's the speech.

TOBY
We're on our way.

CHARLIE
He wants you to bring Will Bailey, too. You want to call him or you want me to?

TOBY
Well, Will's never been called in the middle of the night by the office of the President. 
I think he should experience that before he leaves.

JOSH
Definitely.

He starts to pick up the phone, when someone starts banging on the door. He jumps up 
and runs to the door. The man yells through the door.

MAN [VO] 
Mr. Bailey, it's the night manager. There's a phone call for you.

WILL
Uh, yeah.

He jumps back across the bed and grabs the phone.

WOMAN
Mr. Bailey, this is the White Hoouse operator.

WILL
Yes, ma'am.

WOMAN
Would you hold, please, I have a call for you from Charlie Young.

Will's pager starts vibrating and he picks it up. It reads "POTUS".

CUT TO: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
C.J. comes bursting through the entrance by the Press Room where Danny is waiting. 
They start yelling over each other.

DANNY
This is not what happened.

C.J.
I don't believe this.

DANNY
Listen to me.

C.J.
This is, A] it was garbage. That was... that was totally out of left field on the piece 
on the unnamed White House source...

DANNY
It wasn't mine.

C.J.
What do you mean, it wasn't yours?

DANNY
It got dropped in.

C.J.
Who dropped it in?

DANNY
My editor and my researhcer.

C.J.
They dropped it in?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
Without your knowledge?

DANNY
Yes.

C.J.
And you're okay with that?

DANNY
How do I sound?!

They reach C.J.'S OFFICE.

C.J.
What was the name of the researcher?

DANNY
Oh, you're not...

C.J.
No, the researchers looking out for his future. He's twenty-three and times a-wastin'. 
I want to give him a Lexus. What's his name?

DANNY
C.J..

C.J.
What's his name?!

DANNY
That's going to stay between me and my boss. The reseachers talked to three different 
people on background-- just nuts and bolts.

C.J.
Asking how many nuts and bolts doesn't get this quote.

DANNY
As a matter of form, he's tell them what I'm writing about. C.J., I don't know who he 
talked to.

C.J.
I sent you to Donna when you asked...

DANNY
I'm saying it wasn't necessarily Donna. I mean, in a million years, do you think Donna...

C.J.
No, but that day, yesterday, her boyfriend Jack Reese, a Navy Lieutenant Commander, 
was reassigned from a White House poistion, and she was very angry about it.

DANNY
Sometimes people say something to a researcher 'cause they think they're not on the record.

C.J.
They're not on the record!

DANNY
No.

Carol enters the office.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

CAROL
It's Donna on the phone.

Danny walks out and C.J. picks up the phone as she watches Danny leave through her window.

Josh and Toby are leaning up against the desk waiting.

JOSH
Well. This is gonna, I think, get interesting now.

TOBY
Yes.

JOSH
This is gonna get interesting.

TOBY
It will capture our interest...

JOSH
...and will be written about...

TOBY
...in English, I would think as well as...

JOSH
Arabic?

TOBY
You can say that two times. I suppose you can't blame Will completely.

Will enters.

WILL
Hi.

TOBY
This is entirely your fault.

WILL
He came in the office.

TOBY
You like Europe. He likes Europe. You could have talked about Europe.

WILL
That wasn't the subject.

TOBY
Than make it the subject. He says, "here's this El Salvador speech I gave a long time 
ago," and you say?

WILL
'I like Europe?'

TOBY
Yes.

C.J. enters.

C.J.
Listen, something's happened.

TOBY
What?

C.J.
A White House aide is quoted in tomorrow's Post.

Charlie exits the Oval Office.

CHARLIE
You can go in.

C.J.
All right.

Toby, Will, Josh and C.J. enter THE OVAL OFFICE where Bartlet and Leo are wating. 

BARTLET
We're for freedom of speech everywhere. We're for freedom to worship everywhere. We're 
for freedom to learn... for everybody. And because, in our time, you can build a bomb 
in your country and bring it to my country, what goes on in you country is very much my 
business. And so we are for freedom from tyranny everywhere, whether in the guise of 
political oppresion, Toby, or economic slavery, Josh, or religious fanaticism, C.J. 
That most fundamental idea cannot be met with merely our support. It has to be met with 
our strength. Diplomatically, economically, materially. And if pharoah still don't free 
the slaves, then he gets the plagues, or my cavalry, whichever gets there first. The 
USTR will go crazy and say that we're not considering global trade. Committee members 
will go crazy and say I haven't consulted enough. And the Arab world will just go 
indescriminately crazy. No country has ever had a doctrine of intervention when only 
humanitarian interests were at stake. That streaks going to end Sunday at noon. So, if 
you're on board with this, what I need you to do...

By now, Josh, Toby and Will have begun talking. C.J. has gotten on her cellphone, and 
they're not listening to Bartlet.

TOBY
What we're going to do is comb through the language again, this time with counsel.

C.J.
[to cellphone] Carol? It's me. I'm going to need new talking points for the full Cabinet, 
no embargoed excepts...

TOBY
We have to move from a lone rogue, to a posse.

BARTLET
[to Leo] Do I just keep standing here?

LEO
No. [to the gang] Excuse me! 

They stop talking and turn around.

LEO
It is so ordered.

ALL 
Thank you, Mr. President.

They all exit.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
All right, everything else off the table. [to C.J.] What were you going to say before? 

WILL
I'm going to be on the phone. [exits]

C.J.
Danny's got a piece out tomorrow on fault lines between the White House and the Pentagon.

TOBY
He writes that story twice a year.

C.J.
A researcher gathering background spoke to three people, one of whom was Donna, because 
your office is one of the places that keeps breakdowns of how Pentagon staff are detailed 
to the White House. The researcher was giving an unprompted quote, which he gave to 
Danny's editor, who put it in the piece.

JOSH
What was the quote?

C.J.
Everyone's very loyal to everyone else around here, unless you wear a uniform.

JOSH
I know it sounds like it was Donna 'cause of the situation with Jack, but there's no way 
she gives that quote to a reporter.

C.J.
She didn't think she was on the record.

JOSH
There's no way Donna said that.

C.J.
She did. She just called me and told me she did, which I give her credit for.

JOSH
You do?

TOBY
Heat of the moment. And bad timing.

JOSH
I don't have time for this now. [to C.J.] Neither do you.

They exit.

He hands Leo the drink of water.

LEO
Ten minutes ago, you promised me you'd go easy on the Moses references.

BARTLET
That was Isaiah.

LEO
Still. They frighten people?

BARTLET
Who?

LEO
Me.

BARTLET
Well, then here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women.

LEO
Ah, that tastes like... nothing at all. It has no taste or properties of any kind. You 
can expect to see pieces quoting Pentagon sources on how many lives we'd lose in Khundu. 
And a search and rescue group, diving for a lost helicopter prop, is going to find a 
piece of a Gulfstream.

BARTLET
I think you're wrong. But if you're right, then okay. We should all have a little skin 
in this.

LEO
Well, then, that much we've accomplished.

BARTLET
So we're doing well so far.

LEO
Sunday noon?

BARTLET
Sunday noon.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

CUT TO: EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

	UNITED STATES CAPITOL
	SUNDAY INAUGURATION DAY

The Presidential motorcade is riding down Pennsylvania Avenue towrds the Capitol. There 
is a small crowd of spectators.

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

ABBEY
Because of Laurel and Hardy?

BARTLET
Not because, no. Not because of Laurel and Hardy. That was simply the confluence of 
the final, you know, and... also, by the way, from the mouths of babe-- like yourself. 
Seriously, from the mouths of babes and clowns come-- Listen, there's no reason why 
anyone needs to know about Laurel and Hardy.

ABBEY
Sounds like that's going to depend a lot on my general mood.

BARTLET
Too cold for a parade. Bunch of tanned-ass Southerners.

ABBEY
That decision was made by your Inauguration Chariman, who's from Massachusetts.

BARTLET
Which is to the south of New Hampshire. Don't tell me geographic stereotypes.

ABBEY
You would've been happy walking up Pennsylvania Avenue in this cold?

BARTLET
I walked to school every morning in weather colder than this.

ABBEY
From the headmaster's house to your classroom.

BARTLET
That's right, baby. Just a camel hair coat, leather gloves, a varsity scarf and these wits.

The motorcade pulls into an UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT. Charlie meets Bartlet getting out. 
They begin a walk-and-talk with Ed, Larry, and other staffers in tow.

CHARILE 
Sir.

BARTLET
It's here?

CHARLIE
No, sir.

BARTLET
What is the problem? It was in New York. It could have gotten here on a fast horse.

CHARLIE
They took the Metroliner this morning.

BARTLET
And?

CHARLIE
The train's stuck in Philadelphia.

BARTLET
Because?

CHARLIE
Frozen tracks.

BARTLET
And it didn't come in last night...

CHARLIE
...because the Inaugural Committee wouldn't pay for four hotel rooms.

BARTLET
Three for the freemasons and one for the Bible.

CHARLIE
I guess the Bible doesn't get a room. Three hotel rooms.

BARTLET
Three hotel rooms and four train tickets.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

BARTLET
Okay. You know what? Washington didn't bring his own Bible, he just assumed one would be 
provided, which, frankly, isn't unreasonable. Guy wants you to swear an oath on a Bible, 
he ought to be packing a Bible. Washington had someone get one from across the street.

CHARLIE
[to Ed and Larry] Excuse me, what are the chances there's a Bible in the House Library?

LARRY
They should have one.

ED
Yeah, they got one.

CHARLIE
Excuse me, sir. [runs off]

BARTLET
Just common courtesy I think. "Place your hand on this Bible." And, "Oh, can I use your 
Bible?" That's not right.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
C.J. walks up to Bartlet and the gang.

C.J.
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?

C.J.
Political Affairs thinks it's important.

LARRY
They'd like you to start with the Plain States, followed by the Rust Belt Ball, then the 
one from the Pacific Northwest.

ED
It says you're President of the whole country.

C.J.
Aren't we about to demonstrate that pretty clearly?

LARRY
He could start with the New Hampshire Ball...

The entourage continues to talk as we pan to Toby who is standing in a hallway alone. 
He watches C.J. kiss Bartlet on the cheek. Will comes out of bathroom wiping his mouth.

TOBY
Did you throw up?

WILL
Yeah.

TOBY
About time.

WILL
It was my third time.

TOBY
Still.

C.J. comes walking up.

C.J.
They're yuckling him about the order of the balls.

They go silent and you can hear a band playing.

C.J.
That's the U.S. Marine Corps Band right there. The Commandant's Own. These guys practice 
four hours a day. So you think the Chief Justice has lost his mind.

TOBY
I didn't say he's "lost his mind," I said... I said he lost his mind and Leo said he's 
lost his mind.

C.J.
Leo's lost his mind.

TOBY
Speaking in verse...

C.J.
A literary curse. [looking at watch] Five minutes.

Josh comes walking up.

JOSH
He doesn't have a Bible. Charlie's out looking for one.

C.J.
Should I be...?

JOSH
Charlie'll get it.

Charlie comes running by with a bible in his hands.

CHARLIE
I've got it.

C.J.
So there it is. Let's see what happens now.

They watch Charlie as he runs down the hallway with the Bible.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. BALLROOM - DAY
A band is playing an up-tempo jazz song. People are on the dance floor swing dancing. 
Toby is surrounded by a group of ladies. They are laughing. Leo is across the room 
looking at Toby. Toby leaves the group of women and walks over to Leo. They hug.

LEO
Listen. Will did a great a job, and I like him personally too. But he had a meeting with 
that Public Affairs guy, and people at State are focusing a lot of displeasure on him.

TOBY
I told him to have a bad meeting with that Public Affairs guy.

LEO
I know, and I want to use him again, but I need friends at State right now, so I want 
him to work under the radar. He should work out of his house and deal with us by phone.

TOBY
That's exactly what I was going to say.

LEO
Yeah?

TOBY
Except the part about him working under the radar in his house on the phone. Leo, I 
want the President to appoint him Deputy.

LEO
Are you sure?

TOBY
I can talk to the people at State and--

LEO
I don't care about State. I'm asking... are you sure?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
You don't mean on an interim basis?

TOBY
No.

LEO
What about Sam?

TOBY
A promotion-- it's well past time. Make him a Senior Counselor, take the knucklehead 
stuff off his desk, the way he did for me for four years. Let him concentrate on the 
President and the country.

LEO
I'll advise the President.

Toby walks away from Leo. Leo starts to smile and bop his head to the music. Across the 
ballroom, Danny is weaving his way through the dancers on the floor. He spots Josh.

DANNY
Hey!

JOSH
Hey.

DANNY
Congratulations. This is something. Sorry about the story yesterday.

JOSH
It wasn't your fault.

DANNY
Where is she?

JOSH
Donna?

DANNY
Yeah.

JOSH
She's sitting in her apartment in a ball gown.

DANNY
Waiting for a ball to come over?

JOSH
She doesn't think it's appropriate for her to be here. I couldn't talk her down.

DANNY
How hard you try?

JOSH
I tried hard.

DANNY
She didn't think she was on the record. I'm not sure if my editor knew that one.

JOSH
It doesn't matter.

DANNY
Yeah. I thought the balance of the piece was-- 

JOSH
I haven't read it. Sorry. I haven't.

DANNY
I have a copy here if you want to... 

He reaches in his pocket and pulls out the article.

JOSH
You're walking around with a copy of it? 

DANNY
Well, I think parts of it are pretty good. Hey, when you won a Fulbright Scholarship 
you taped the letter to your face.

JOSH
Give me that. [grabs the article and reads] Yeah, here it is. "Said one White House 
aide, 'We've got a situation--'"

DANNY
The point was to actually read all the other parts.

JOSH
"...'where the White House won't give the D.O.D an extra ten billion so they have to 
go to the Hill and get it.' Said the same aide, "Everybody's very loyal around here 
unless you wear a uniform,'" said the same aide. I hadn't read the first part of the 
quote. Said the same aide? I'm going to kill her.

CUT TO: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
A cab is driving down a residential street. The street is blanket with snow. The cab 
stops and Josh, Toby, Charlie, Will and Danny get out.

TOBY
[to cab driver] Why don't you stick around for a minute. [to Josh] We're just going 
to be a minute, right?

JOSH
Quick review.

TOBY
[to cab driver] Wait just one minute.

JOSH
It's good cop/bad cop. I'm the good cop; the four of you are the bad cop. Will, what 
are you?

WILL
The bad cop.

JOSH
Danny what are you?

DANNY
The bad cop.

JOSH
Toby, what are you?

TOBY
Hurry up.

JOSH
Charlie, who are you?

CHARLIE
I love Zoey, and I must have her back.

JOSH
The bad cop, that's right. Here we go.

Josh runs up to the door of the building. The rest are still standing in the middle 
of the road.

WILL
That's great news about Zoey. I didn't meet her, but I bet she's nice.

CHARLIE
Not really, but my love for her knows no bounds.

DANNY
Charlie, aren't you cold without a coat?

CHARLIE
I took off my coat to show my love for Zoey.

DANNY
Wow.

CHARLIE
I'd take off my shirt too, but it's inappropriate with a tuxedo.

DANNY
Not if we're at Chipendales.

TOBY
[to Josh] I'm standing here!

JOSH
[coming back down the steps] The buzzer's not working.

TOBY
Did you try it?

JOSH
No, I divined it.

DANNY
Maybe she's just not answering.

JOSH
The buzzer's not working. There's a note that says the buzzer's not working.

TOBY
Call her.

JOSH
No, I know women. I know what they're like. [yelling] Donna!

DANNY
I think before tonight's over, we might have ourselves a whole new story.

Toby starts to laugh. Josh picks up some snow and makes a snowball. He hurls it at her 
window, but he misses.

JOSH
Huh.

He makes another snowball and misses. The others follow suit. They are now all throwing 
snowballs at Donna's window.

DANNY
Ho!

TOBY
Yeah!

JOSH
Here we go.

They finally hit the window and Donna appears. She lifts up her window but they continue 
to throw snowballs, almost hitting her.

DONNA
What the hell are you doing?

JOSH
Get down here! Now!

DONNA
Keep your voice down.

JOSH
Don't even think about telling me to keep my voice! Get down here!

DONNA
I'm coming.

Donna puts down her window and disappears. A neighbor from across the street has opened 
his window and yells down at them.

MAN 1
Hey, now I'm telling you-- keep your voice down.

MAN 2
Me too.

JOSH
Oh, no, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to wake you guys. Uh, this is a special situation. It's 
okay, I'm the good cop.

TOBY
[into cellphone] Hi, National Inquirer?

Donna comes walking out of her house. Josh runs up to her taking off his coat. 

JOSH
You come down here without a coat?

DONNA
I need you to keep your voice down.

Josh puts his coat around Donna.

DONNA
Go ahead, you're entitled-- give it to me all again.

JOSH
You don't know the White House rejected ten billion for the D.O.D. You have absolutely 
no way of knowing that. Jack said it. The researcher called Jack, and Jack said it.

DONNA
He was working a lot of nights, and it really wore him out.

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
And then this thing happened, and he didn't think he was on the record.

JOSH
Donna--

DONNA
He didn't, Josh. That was legitimate.

JOSH
He's letting you take credit for this?

DONNA
Listen, this guys got an important career ahead of him.

JOSH
Your career isn't important? What was the point of anyone claiming... You knew it was 
easy... to figure out it was him.

DONNA
Not as easy as you made it. I didn't think about the top of the quote--

JOSH
The list of things you didn't think about, including your job, what the President 
thinks of you.

DONNA
Does he know about this?

JOSH
He's about to. You look amazing.

DONNA
[to the guys still standing in the street] Hi, guys.

WILL, CHARLIE and DANNY
Hi, Donna.

TOBY
Donna.

DONNA
Sorry about all this.

TOBY
Don't worry about it.

DANNY
It was stupid, but it was menschy.

JOSH
[to Danny] Hey, hey, hey. Good cop/bad cop.

DANNY
Sorry, it was just stupid.

DONNA
Hey, Will, you and Toby wrote maybe the greatest speech I've ever heard.

WILL
Thank you very much.

JOSH
[to Donna] We're going to a ball.

DONNA
Balls are fun.

JOSH
We're actually going to eight of them.

DONNA
Eight times the fun.

JOSH
I was actually the one who hit the window, the rest of them went to school on my throw.

TOBY
Let's go!

Josh puts out his arm and Donna grabs it. They all begin to walk to the cab.

DONNA
How you doing, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Well, I'm going to win Zoey's heart from Jean-Paul.

DONNA
Excellent.

CHARLIE
'Cause he may be good-looking and rich and well schooled and French royalty, you know, 
and live basically in a castle, but... Oh, God.

TOBY
This is what I've been telling you. Get in the car.

Everyone is now in the cab but Donna and Josh.

DONNA
Josh... I'm sorry. Seriously, I've never lied to you before, boss, and it won't happen 
again.

JOSH
You're going to have to sit on somebody's lap.

DONNA
Okay.

Josh and Donna start to get in the cab.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. BALLROOM -  NIGHT
The band is playing a slow jazz song. People are are on the dance floor dancing. 
C.J. and Leo are at a bar getting handed drinks from the bar tender.

LEO
[to bar tender] Thank you.

C.J.
You should expect increased voices of dissent after today - in breadth and depth.

LEO
A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships were build for.

C.J.
It's doubtful Danny's inquiries about Shareef would have gone further if he didn't have 
new sources at the Pentagon.

LEO
So what?

C.J.
Really?

LEO
You know what the decision directives say? That diplomats and leaders aren't immune 
from being targets when they're connected to terrorist activities that threaten the 
U.S. or its citizens. I don't think it's an unusual directive.

C.J.
That it was given hours before Shareef's plane disappeared... Just a reminder, the more 
I know, the more I can help you. And don't be concerned with my exposure. I'm not your 
daughter. I'm the White House Press Secretary.

Charlie walks up.

CHARLIE
The President would like you both.

CUT TO: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Toby, C.J., Leo, Will, Josh, Donna, and Abbey are all waiting in a room when Bartlet 
and Charlie walk in.

BARTLET
Good evening.

ALL
Good evening, Mr. President.

Bartlet walks over to Abbey who kisses him on the cheek, then she wipes the lipstick 
on his cheek off.

BARTLET
Everything all right?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
They're saying I'm rewriting the Constitution on the back of a napkin. They're saying 
on FOX that a guy who couldn't run a local sheriff's department wants to send troops 
around the world. They're saying it's liberalism with a grenade launcher. But they're 
not saying it was badly written, so that's something. And they sure as hell know I was 
serious, so that's something else. Congratulations, folks. We've got ourselves a doctrine. 

They applaud.

BARTLET
Will, I think some of these people don't know who your dad is. Will's the youngest son 
of Tom Bailey, who's the only guy in the world with a better title than mine. He was 
Supreme Commander, NATO Allied Forces Europe. We didn't know we were going to do this. 
I would have asked you to invite him.

WILL
Well, you got quite a response from him watching on TV, sir. I think he's going to 
reenlist.

BARTLET
Actually, I meant he could be here now when I tell you Toby's asked me to commission 
you as his deputy.

WILL
I'm sorry, sir?

BARTLET
Toby wants to make you deputy.

WILL
Pardon me?

BARTLET
I'm appointing you Deputy Communications Director. It covers a wide range of areas of 
policy and execution and counsel to me.

WILL
To you... the President?

BARTLET
Yes.

WILL
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not following-- are you...

LEO
Good God, boy.

JOSH
I remeber when you named me Deputy, there was a dull buzzing in my ear, or a humming. 
It was very disorienting.

C.J.
The same thing happened to me.

JOSH
Hang in there Will, you're doing fine.

DONNA
[in Josh's ear] That was a nice story about the buzzing.

JOSH
What did I say about speaking to me without addressing me as Wild Thing.

BARTLET
[to Will] Excuse me? 

Will looks.

BARTLET
Hi. [motions Will to come closer] Sam's going to be promoted to Senior Counselor if 
he loses the 47th.

WILL
I don't know what to say.

BARTLET
[to the gang] That's what you want to hear from your new Communications--

WILL
I-I accept.

BARTLET
There's a promise that I ask everyone who works here to make. Never doubt that a small 
group of thoughtful and commited citizens can change the world. You know why?

WILL
It's the only thing that ever has.

BARTLET
William Bailey, reposing special trust and confidence in your integrety, prudence and 
ability, I designate you to the post of Deputy White House Director of Communications 
and Special Assistant to the President. And I do authorize you to execute and fulfill 
the duties of that office with all the powers and privileges and subject to the 
conditions prescribed. It is affirmed by my signature... 

Charlie hands Bartlet a Certificate and a pen. Bartlet signs the certificate and hands 
the pen to Will.

BARTLET
...and affixed with the Seal of of the Unites States. 

Charlie hands bartlet a stamp. Bartlet stamps the certificate.

BARTLET
And it is done so on this day and in this place. 

He hands the certificate to Will.

BARTLET
Congratulations.

They clap for Will. He goes around and shakes all of their hands.

BARTLET
[holding a piece of paper in his hand] You know, it's easy to watch the news and think 
of Khundunese as either hapless victims or crazed butchers, and it turns out that's not 
true. I got this intelligence summary this afternoon. "Mothers are standing in front of 
tanks." And we're going to go get their backs. An hour ago, I ordered Fitzwallace to 
have UCOMM deploy a brigade of the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Air Assualt, and a Marine 
Expeditionary Unit to Khundu to stop the violence. The 101st are the Screaming Eagles. 
The Marines are with the 22nd M.E.U., trained at Camp Lejuene, some of them very recently. 
I'm sorry, everyone, but this is a work night.

Bartlet grabs Abbey's hand, and they all walk out of the room. Will is still standing 
there.

LEO
That's you too.

WILL
I know.

Will walks out of the room.

CUT TO: INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
Two Secret Service agents open the doors as Bartlet and Abbey walk out together followed 
by C.J. and Toby, Charlie, Josh and Donna, Will, then Leo. Headed for the front door, 
they cut through the dance floor as people are dancing.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
