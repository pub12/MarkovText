Another officer, JACK, comes over to look at the screen.

OFFICER [cont.]
Last pass with the CAGE satellite.

JACK
How old is this?

OFFICER
About twenty minutes.

JACK
Go to X-10 inside the grid.

OFFICER
[zooms in on a section of the grid] Those are two CVEs and four destroyers.

JACK
Let’s get some help.

CUT TO: INT. THE PENTAGON - NIGHT
Two men, one in uniform and one not, are talking. Another uniformed officer enters.
 
ARMY GUY 1
[entering] So far we can identify elements of the Northern, Central, and Western command 
armies. They all appear to be front-line divisions. We’re working up divisional ID.

ARMY GUY 2
What about the navy?

ARMY GUY 1
We’re getting e-lint. Two CVEs, four destroyers -

ARMY GUY 2
Where they heading?

ARMY GUY 1
Pakistan.

ARMY GUY 3
I’m sold. Let’s brief the COs.

ARMY GUY 2
I’ll get on the phone with the White House.

He goes to the phone and starts dialing as the other two leave.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Josh and Donna leave his office and walk down the hallway.

JOSH
You’ll like it.

DONNA
It doesn’t sound like I’ll like it.

JOSH
Caddying?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
It’s great!

DONNA
Don’t I just lug your golf clubs around?

JOSH
Well, it’s good exercise.

DONNA
Of course it’s good exercise, I’m lugging your golf clubs around.

JOSH
You’ll be doing more than that, Donna. You’ll be reading the greens, you’ll be helping 
with club selection.

WHITE HOUSE GUARD [OS]
Here he is now.

JOSH
Who, me?

They turn to the NORTHWEST LOBBY.

SUBPOENA MAN
Joshua Lyman?

JOSH
Oh, man.

SUBPOENA MAN
Are you Joshua Lyman?

JOSH
Is this Claypool again?

SUBPOENA MAN
Mr. Lyman, you’re being served with a subpoena to give deposi...

JOSH
[to guard] Why do you let him in the building?

SUBPOENA MAN
Sir, if you’ll just sign as to show proof of-

JOSH
Gimme that. [signing the paper on Donna’s back] 
This is like the 43rd time -- This is Freedom Watch, right?

SUBPOENA MAN
Yes sir.

JOSH
Yeah, you guys are real patriots.

SUBPOENA MAN
I hope this hasn’t inconvenienced you too much.

JOSH
[handing back the signed paper] Being subpoenaed? No. Why would that inconvenience me?

SUBPOENA MAN
[as he leaves] Have a good day, sir.

JOSH
Thank you. Drop dead. [to Donna] It’s what I do now. I’m a professional hostile witness. 

DONNA
Would I get to drive the cart?

They go through a door into a HALLWAY.

JOSH
No carts.

DONNA
You don’t use a cart?

JOSH
No. Real golfers don’t use carts.

DONNA
Don’t they also carry their own clubs?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Would you pay me extra? 

JOSH
No.

DONNA
You play in the winter?

JOSH
I would wait until spring, but I’d want you to start practicing with that bag right away.

Donna stops, then veers off. Josh turns to walk into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. 
Mrs. Landingham is at her desk when Josh enters.
 
JOSH
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How are you, Josh?

JOSH
I’ve been subpoenaed.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I’m sorry, dear. Would you like a cookie?

JOSH
[taking one] Yes, thanks. The President asked me to come by.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The President just left with Leo.

JOSH
Where’d they go?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The Situation Room.

Josh puts the cookie back in the jar and walks out.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Military and Intelligence staff are seated around the table. They all start to rise as 
Bartlet and Leo enter.

BARTLET
Keep your seats. [beat, they all sit] Admiral Fitzwallace?

Admiral Fitzwallace comes to the table, passing a staffer who is setting a clock to 
Kashmir time.

FITZWALLACE
[sits] Mr. President, twenty-five minutes ago, the Indian army launched an invasion 
along the Kashmir cease-fire line, into Pakistan-held Kashmir territory.

BARTLET
Is it clear what India’s objective is?

FITZWALLACE
No sir.

BARTLET
When you say “the Indian army,” what are we talking about?

FITZWALLACE
Sir?

BARTLET
Five guys in a Humvee? What?

FITZWALLACE
Mitch?

MITCH
Sir, they committed the 4th motorized infantry division, the 9th and 26th infantry 
divisions, and two other armored brigades, as well as four CVEs and two destroyers.

Bartlet is now reading from a paper that’s been handed to him.

LEO
All told?

FITZWALLACE
Approximately 300,000 troops, sir.

BARTLET
[looking up] In the last twenty-five minutes?

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim.

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
This was long planned.

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
All I’m trying to do right now? I’m trying to avoid making eye contact with the CIA Director.

CIA DIRECTOR
Mr. President...

BARTLET
300,000 troops? I can’t move my motorcade from K Street to Connecticut without it showing 
up on a weather satellite.

CIA DIRECTOR
We dropped the ball, Sir.

BARTLET
Pick it up again, would you please?

CIA DIRECTOR
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Any chance this is an exercise?

FITZWALLACE
No sir.

BARTLET
A threat gesture?

FITZWALLACE
Possibly.

BARTLET
Any nuclear activity?

FITZWALLACE
We don’t know sir.

BARTLET
Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that, that’s probably not important information.

CIA DIRECTOR
We’ve obviously ordered intense surveillance.

LEO
How intense?

CIA DIRECTOR
The nearest orbiting satellites have been diverted to the area. The KH Super Platform 
has been tasked into stationary orbit over the Northern subcontinent.

LEO
How long till it’s on station?

FITZWALLACE
Six hours, sir.

BARTLET
All right. I’m ordering the Crisis Task Force activated, and I want you to prepare to 
give me a national security briefing. Thank you.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Toby and Sam are walking quickly along the outside corridor toward the President’s office.

SAM
What’s the ambassador’s name?

TOBY
Which ambassador?

SAM
The Pakistani ambassador.

TOBY
You’re saying our guy in Pakistan, or their guy here?

SAM
Our guy in Pakistan.

TOBY
We haven’t appointed one yet.

SAM
You’re kidding.

They go through the door into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

TOBY
[to Sam] Nope.

CHARLIE
Hey, Toby.

TOBY
Hey Charlie.

CHARLIE
Sam.

SAM
Charlie.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good evening, Sam. Good evening, Toby.

TOBY
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.

SAM
[to Toby] It’s been over a year.

TOBY
What are you talking to me for?

SAM
We have no one in Pakistan?

TOBY
That’s right.

SAM
Maybe that’s why they got invaded.

TOBY
Yeah.

They go into THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet, Josh and Leo are already present.

LEO
The Pakistanis have about 20,000 mountain terrain troops at the frontier command along 
the Northern front, and four divisions at the 10th corps along the Eastern front.

JOSH
All this happened without the CIA knowing about it?

BARTLET
I’ve already had words. TOBY, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in an emergency 
session to try to affect a cease-fire.

TOBY
Well, I feel better already, Mr. President.

SAM
How could we not have an ambassador in Pakistan?

BARTLET
We were getting to it.

TOBY
How could the CIA miss 300,000 armed people walking all over-

BARTLET
They didn’t exactly miss them. In fact, they’ve got a very good photo now.

TOBY
Yeah, but the idea is to spot them before they cross the border, right?

BARTLET
Yeah.

TOBY
Oops.

JOSH
For the moment we’re just talking about conventional weapons, right?

BARTLET
Toby, how much do you know about India and Pakistan?

TOBY
I know that any war between these two countries that begins with conventional weapons 
isn’t gonna end that way.

LEO
Wanna take care of briefing the Hill?

JOSH
Yeah.
 
C.J.
[enters] Good evening.

BARTLET
Hello.

C.J.
I’m sorry. Charlie and Mrs. Landingham stepped away. Should I go back and wait in the...

LEO
Uh, no, we were just breaking up.

C.J.
Can I tell the room there’s a full lid?

LEO
Yeah. [looks at Bartlet, who nods]

C.J.
Okay. I’ll send ‘em home.

BARTLET
Thanks, C.J.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President. [exits]

LEO
[to Toby] I’ll brief her in the morning.

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Charlie is typing at the computer. Zoey enters.

ZOEY
Hey, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Hey.

ZOEY
How ya doin’?

CHARLIE
[standing] Good. 

ZOEY
Is he in?

CHARLIE
I’ll tell him you’re here.

ZOEY
Nah, that’s okay.

CHARLIE
He’ll want to know you’re here.

ZOEY
I’ll just wait.

CHARLIE
Okay.

ZOEY
So, Charlie, do you ever get a night off?

CHARLIE
No, actually.

ZOEY
That’s too bad.

CHARLIE
No, it’s all right.

ZOEY
No, I meant ‘cause it’d be cool to go out or something.

CHARLIE
Yeah. [pause] I’m sorry, with me?

ZOEY
Charlie, you know you don’t have to stand up the whole time I’m in a room.

CHARLIE
Yeah. I don’t know why I do that. [sits]

Josh and Sam are coming out of the Oval Office.

JOSH
Hi Zoey.

BARTLET [OS]
Is that Zoey?

ZOEY
[to Charlie] Anyway, too bad.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

SAM
Zoey.

Sam and Josh leave, and Zoey goes into the Oval Office. Charlie looks thoughtful.

CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh and Sam are walking back to their offices.

JOSH
I’ve been subpoenaed. 

SAM
By Claypool? 

JOSH
Under the Freedom of Information Act. It’s reported that I was running the internal 
investigation after Lillienfield accused us all of being on drugs.

SAM
Well, not all of us, Josh. Just one in three.

JOSH
Right.

SAM
So Claypool’s suing you for the paperwork?

JOSH
I’m being deposed at lunch tomorrow.

SAM
Who you bringing?

JOSH
I’m not bringing anyone.

SAM
Josh.

JOSH
It’s a non-event.

SAM
You should bring a lawyer.

JOSH
I am a lawyer.

SAM
Yeah. Seriously, you should bring a real lawyer.

JOSH
Thanks for the pep talk.

SAM
No sweat.

MANDY
[catches up] Joshua.

JOSH
Madeline.

MANDY
What’s up?

JOSH
Not too much.

MANDY
We’re gonna look good in California.

JOSH
I’m gonna look pale.

MANDY
I meant the President.

JOSH
I know. I’m just sayin’. [goes into his office]

MANDY
Sam, could I talk to you for a second?

SAM
Yeah.

MANDY
In your office?

SAM
Yeah.

MANDY
Thanks.

They walk into SAM’S OFFICE.

SAM
What’s up?

MANDY
I’m thinking of taking on a new client and I think it might be a problem for Josh and 
Toby and I was hoping that maybe you could help smooth the way.

SAM
Who?

MANDY
Hmm?

SAM
Who’s the client?

MANDY
Mike Brace.

Sam starts to laugh.

MANDY 
Sam.

SAM
You’re serious?

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
Mike Brace is a Republican.

MANDY
You think I don’t know that?

SAM
You think Josh and Toby might have a problem with that?

MANDY
Sam, he’s moderate-to-liberal, he’s good on education, he’s good on women’s rights...

SAM
And he’s a Republican.

MANDY
He came to me.

SAM
That’s understandable.

MANDY
He sought me out.

SAM
You’re very good. We’d come to you too.

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
In fact, we did.

MANDY
Yes. And I’m coming to you now.

SAM
To get me to help you convince Josh and Toby to let you work for a Republican.

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
[sitting down at his desk] This is just my lucky day.

MANDY
Sam, I think you are the one senior guy here who is more interested in getting things 
done than beating the other...

SAM
That’s not true, Mandy. Josh and Toby are just as committed...

MANDY
Not lately. 

SAM
I disagree.

MANDY
The banking bill, the land-use rider, assault weapons? You like Mike Brace.

SAM
Mandy.

MANDY
I know.

SAM
This is going to be an impossible sell.

MANDY
It shouldn’t be.

SAM
But it will be.

MANDY
I know.

SAM
I admire your pluck.

MANDY
I’m sorry, what part of me do you admire?

SAM
Your pluck. Your gumption.

MANDY
Thank you.

SAM
You’re welcome.

MANDY
So you’re going to talk to Josh and Toby?

SAM
You’re gonna owe me a big favor.

MANDY
[going to the door] Sam.

SAM
All right, we’ll be even.

MANDY
Sam!

SAM
All right, I’ll do this and many more favors for you and we’ll be even.

MANDY
Thank you. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
Several reporters are present. C.J. enters and goes to the podium.

C.J.
Hi. We’re gonna have a briefing by the Treasury Department on the market adjustment...

REPORTER
Market adjustment?

C.J.
That’s what we’ve been asked to call it. That’s going to be nine tomorrow morning. 
With that, the lid is full, you can all go home.

REPORTERS
C.J.!

Toby has entered and is standing at the back of the room.

C.J.
Bruce?

BRUCE
I’ve got a source at the Pentagon who says in the last few hours there’s been massive 
troop movement on the Kashmir border.

C.J.
In the last few hours?

BRUCE
Yeah.

C.J.
I think you need to get a new source at the Pentagon, Bruce.

BRUCE
There’s nothing to it?

C.J.
What kind of troop movement?

BRUCE
Something like 300,000 troops and a few warships?

C.J.
300,000 troops?

BRUCE
Yeah.

C.J.
I think someone’s havin’ a little fun with you, Bruce.

BRUCE
You sure?

C.J.
I was just in the Oval Office ten minutes ago.

BRUCE
Okay.

C.J.
Have a good night, everybody.

The reporters exit. CLOSE UP on Toby.

CUT TO: EXT./EST. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Bartlet, Leo, and other Military and Intelligence staff are seated around the table. 
Fitzwallace is at the map projected on the wall.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, already intense fighting has occurred between Indian troops and Pakistani border 
garrisons. The cease-fire line’s been breached in two thrusts, with five divisions invading 
the area north of Kargil, and a two-corps-sized force that’s crossed west into Azhad.

BARTLET
Bobby?

BOBBY
In the past hour, Prime Minister Nohammed has spoken on television, saying that 
[reading from a paper] “after enduring endless provocations and incessant acts of 
thuggery by the criminal gang running Pakistan, India’s forbearance has been exhausted. 
In the name of peace, India is acting to put an end to Pakistan’s outlaw aggression once 
and for all.”

LEO
And Pakistan?

INTELLIGENCE GUY
They’re condemning India’s unlawful aggression and pledging all-out resistance.

BARTLET
Well, we’ve got ourselves a ballgame.

FITZWALLACE
Yes sir.

LEO
When do we get the nuclear briefing?

INTELLIGENCE GUY
This afternoon, 1500.

BARTLET
3:00.

INTELLIGENCE GUY
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Thank you.

They all rise and thank the President. 

CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Toby and Donna are walking down the hall.

DONNA
-- through the Freedom of Information Act.

TOBY
What kind of information are they looking for?

DONNA
He has information about the investigation.

TOBY
It wasn’t an investigation.

DONNA
I’m sure Josh’ll mention that.

TOBY
Did he bring a lawyer?

DONNA
Said he didn’t need one.

TOBY
Oh, good, I like the sound of this.

They arrive at LEO’S OFFICE. Donna turns off toward her office, Toby meets Margaret 
leaving the office.

TOBY
[to Margaret] Hello.

MARGARET
Leo’s coming and C.J.’s already inside.

TOBY
Thanks.

TOBY goes into LEO’S OFFICE.

C.J.
Hi. You know what this is about?

TOBY
Yeah. I stopped by your office before but...

C.J.
I was at the reception.

LEO
[arrives] Hi C.J.

C.J.
What’s going on?

LEO
India sent troops into the neutral zone in Kashmir. The U.N Security Council’s gonna 
try to negotiate a cease-fire, but we believe we’re gonna start to play a role in the 
next forty-eight to seventy-two hours. You can start to brief the press tonight, so 
I want you in on some of the meeting stuff today.

MARGARET
[enters] Leo...

LEO
[pointing across the hall] Oh, including this one.

C.J.
This happened last night?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
That’s what you all were talking about when I walked into the Oval Office?

LEO
I’m sorry, C.J., we...

C.J.
You told me the lid was on.

LEO
You’re gonna have to expect that sometimes.

C.J.
I got the question, Leo. A guy had a Pentagon source, I denied it. I called it ridiculous.

LEO
We know.

C.J.
Is it 300,000 troops?

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
A couple of destroyers?

TOBY
And four CVEs.

C.J.
The guy hit it right on the button. I made fun of him.

LEO
We’ll tell the room you spoke without knowing the facts.

C.J.
I guess that’s what I’ll do.

LEO
C.J.

C.J.
Don’t worry about it.

LEO
As soon as you tell ‘em India’s the story, this is forgotten.

C.J.
I’m fine. We’re across the hall?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J. exits. Leo and Toby share a look.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
Josh is seated across the table from CLAYPOOL. The deposition is being recorded on 
videotape with a live monitor. There are few other people in the room.

CLAYPOOL
Occupation?

JOSH
White House Deputy Chief of Staff.

CLAYPOOL
How long have you held this job?

JOSH
Since President Bartlet was sworn in, 12 months ago.

CLAYPOOL
Have you been conducting, over the past few weeks, an internal investigation into 
recreational drug use by White House staffers?

JOSH
I wouldn’t call it an investigation.

CLAYPOOL
Why not?

JOSH
It wasn’t that serious.

CLAYPOOL
You don’t consider illegal drug use at the White House to be serious?

JOSH
Whoa. Almost tripped me up in that clever web of words. No, I would consider drug use 
in the White House to be serious; I wouldn’t consider my investigation serious, and 
the way you know it wasn’t serious is that I was the one running it.

CLAYPOOL
What prompted the investigation?

JOSH
Congressman Lillienfield held a press conference in which he claimed that one in three 
White House staffers use drugs. I was asked to discover what, if anything, might have 
caused him to say that.

CLAYPOOL
Asked by whom?

JOSH
The Chief of Staff and the Communications Director.

CLAYPOOL
Leo McGarry and Toby Ziegler.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
As I’m sure you’re aware, the organization I represent is suing under the Freedom of 
Information Act for the records of your investigation.

JOSH
Yes, and I can save us all a lot of time by telling you that there are no records of 
my investigation. 

CLAYPOOL
Before being deposed here today, did you talk to anybody about the fact that we were 
requiring your testimony?

JOSH
I mentioned it to a few people.

CLAYPOOL
Who were they?

JOSH
Sam Seaborn.

CLAYPOOL
The Deputy Communications Director.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Why’d you mention it to him?

JOSH
No particular reason.

CLAYPOOL
No particular reason?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Really.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
You brought up the subpoena for no particular reason.

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Who else?

JOSH
My assistant, Donna Moss.

CLAYPOOL
Well, what did you tell Mr. Seaborn and Miss Moss about this deposition?

JOSH
I told them that I had to waste a day on this deposition.

CLAYPOOL
What else did you tell them?

JOSH
I probably told them that I consider these moronic lawsuits of yours to be...

CLAYPOOL
Why do you persist in...?

JOSH
Because you have consistently acted not as someone determined to get the truth, but 
someone who hates President Bartlet, hates people who support President Bartlet, and 
is looking to make headlines and money. Now you have two hours today, and two hours 
tomorrow. Look, will somebody please offer me some coffee? 

CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Larry and Ed are briefing Toby, C.J., and Sam.

LARRY
India’s population stands at roughly one billion. 82% are Hindus, 11% are Muslim.

ED
They’re mostly poor, but nearly as bad off as Pakistanis.

LARRY
Yes, whose average per capita income is $400.

ED
They are, however, better educated. Their literacy rate is 48%.

LARRY
And they’re healthier. Average lifespan is 57.7 years.

ED
The average rainfall...

TOBY
What the hell kind of briefing is this?

LARRY
Toby, if we could just have another hour to prepare...

TOBY
Where’d you get this stuff?

LARRY
I swear to God, the Encyclopedia Britannica.

C.J.
[rising to leave] I need a briefing.

TOBY
[as she leaves] C.J., we’re getting someone from State...

SAM
She’ll get over it.

TOBY
Yeah.

Toby and Sam rise to leave the room.

SAM
Listen. Let me ask you something without your head exploding?

TOBY
What?

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

SAM
What would your first reaction be to Mandy’s working for Mike Brace?

TOBY
What do you mean?

SAM
He came to her.

TOBY
She wants to work for Mike Brace?

SAM
She’s thinking about it.

They have arrived at the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good afternoon Toby, Sam.

SAM
Hey, Mrs. Landingham.

TOBY
Is this a joke?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You’re not going to say hello, Toby?

TOBY
Yes, hello. Is this a joke?

SAM
No.

TOBY
I don’t understand.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY
I’m in disbelief.

SAM
What should I say your first reaction was?

TOBY
Disbelief.

SAM
He’s good on education, good on women’s rights.

TOBY
Are you shilling for her?

SAM
I’m not shilling. I’m just smoothing the way.

TOBY
Don’t do that.

SAM
She just asked me to take your temperature.

TOBY
And please don’t do that.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Toby and Sam enter. Bartlet and Leo are being briefed by Intelligence staff. 
There are several other people in the room.

JOE
India has two intermediate-range ballistic missiles named Agni 1 and Agni 2. Agni 
means ‘fire’ in Hindi. They have a 55-kiloton A-bomb which is roughly 50% more 
destructive than the Hiroshima bomb. But they also have a thermonuclear device.

LEO
An H-bomb.

JOE
Yeah.

TOBY
Joe, can you assess the command and control situation?

JOE
Well, this is the truly terrifying part.

TOBY
Good, ‘cause we were waiting for a truly terrifying part.

JOE
CCI systems are notoriously unreliable. They put their money in the weapons and ignore 
safeguards.

BARTLET
Like what?

JOE
Dual launch controls, clear chain of commands, satellite surveillance, mutual monitoring, 
exhaustive testing. Also, leaders are reluctant to share information for fear that it 
might weaken them. I’ll read this from a DOD overview. [reading] “At various times, both 
countries have displayed an incoherent decision-making system. You cannot predict what 
will happen in a crisis.”

BARTLET
Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove and we’re all set.

LEO
Thanks, Joe.

JOE
Sure.

Joe thanks the President and leaves with his staff.

BARTLET
There’s an India expert I want to bring in.

LEO
Who?

Bartlet looks at him pointedly.

LEO 
No.

BARTLET
You guys are gonna love him.

LEO
He’s a lunatic!

BARTLET
He’s colorful.

LEO
He’s certifiable!

SAM
Who?

BARTLET
Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James.

SAM
Where do we find him?

LEO
A psychiatric institution.

BARTLET
He’s colorful, Leo.

LEO
You’re really gonna let him loose in the White House, where there’s liquor and women?

BARTLET
We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.

LEO
Sir...

BARTLET
Let’s get him on a plane.

SAM
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Anything else?

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

They all rise. Sam and Toby leave the room.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Toby and Sam are walking back to their offices from the Oval Office.

SAM
Can I just say this about Mandy’s representing Mike Brace?

TOBY
No.

SAM
Okay.

TOBY
I feel like I should say something to C.J.

SAM
Don’t.

TOBY
You think?

SAM
It would be patronizing. If you don’t say anything, that’ll tell her that you think 
she’s a professional.

TOBY
I’m gonna go see her.

SAM
See what you do? You ask me my advice and then you ignore it.

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
Okay. 

CUT TO: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is reviewing press releases.

C.J.
Carol?

CAROL
[enters] Yes?

C.J.
In the next few weeks, it’s going to be important that the White House reassure 
Americans and the world that the President has a firm grip on the crisis and is 
working hard to defuse it.

CAROL
Yes.

C.J.
They’re misspelling ‘New Delhi.’

CAROL
They put the ‘h’ in the wrong place?

C.J.
Hey, I’m happy when they use an ‘h’ at all.

CAROL
We’ll fix it.

TOBY
[arrives] Hey, Carol.

CAROL
[leaving] We’re fixing the ‘h.’

TOBY
Okay. [to C.J.] I was warned that coming to talk to you might be insulting to your 
professionalism.

C.J.
Well, you wouldn’t want to do that.

TOBY
I wasn’t ready for the press yet.

C.J.
Could've told me that before sending me in there.

TOBY
C.J.

C.J.
I flatly denied it. I said I was in the Oval Office ten minutes ago and nothing’s going on.

TOBY
They don’t think you lied to them.

C.J.
I know that. They think you lied to me, which is what happened. They don’t know me. 
I’m from nowhere. I was just starting to get credible. I was just starting to get 
their respect. You know how long it’s going to take me to get it back?

TOBY
There’s a concern.

C.J.
Don’t ask C.J., she doesn’t know anything.

TOBY
There is a concern that you’re too friendly with the press.

C.J.
Really.

TOBY
We know it’s important that you have a friendly relationship with them-

C.J.
It’s important for all of us.

TOBY
I don’t disagree.

C.J.
Does this have to do with Danny Concannon?

TOBY
People see you with Danny.

C.J.
This is outrageous.

TOBY
This is one time, and if we erred, it’s on the side of trying to-

C.J.
You sent me in there uninformed so that I’d lie to the press-

TOBY
We sent you in there uninformed because we thought there was a chance you couldn’t.

C.J.
Okay. I have all this work to do.

TOBY
Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Toby is coming from C.J.’s office when he meets Josh returning to the office.

TOBY
Hey. How’d it go?

JOSH
It was fine.

TOBY
Got to go back tomorrow?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
Take a lawyer.

JOSH
You get 450 bucks an hour?

TOBY
No.

JOSH
Then mind your own business.

TOBY
Take Sam.

JOSH
It’s nothing. It’s this guy.

TOBY
Sam’s going with you.

JOSH
Oh, absolutely, ‘cause in the middle of an international crisis, what better place 
to put our resources?

TOBY
It’s two hours, just do it.

JOSH
C.J. pissed?

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is reading when Charlie enters.

CHARLIE
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
The Chinese ambassador’s at the gate and he’ll be in the Mural Room in a moment.

BARTLET
This ought to be delightful.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Thanks for staying late, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Mmm hmm. Mr. President, I was wondering if I could ask you a question.

BARTLET
Sure.

CHARLIE
I was wondering how you would feel about my going out on a date with Zoey.

BARTLET
I’m sorry?

CHARLIE
Well, Zoey was talking to me before, and she mentioned that if I had a free night-

BARTLET
My daughter asked you out?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
I should have locked her in the dungeon.

CHARLIE
I don’t think you’ve got one, sir.

BARTLET
I could have built one.

CHARLIE
Sir, if it’s not too much-

BARTLET
Charlie, you have picked the absolute worst time in the world to talk to me about this.

LEO
[enters] I think he’s here.

BARTLET
Okay.

CHARLIE
Thank you, sir. [leaves]

BARTLET
Yes. [to Leo] He wants to go out with Zoey.

Leo starts to smile.

BARTLET
Shut up!

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
The CHINESE AMBASSADOR is in the room when Bartlet and Leo enter. They meet and shake hands.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you for seeing us so late, and on such short notice.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Thank you. Good evening, Leo.

LEO
Good evening.

BARTLET
Please sit down.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Thank you.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador, it is crucial that we join together to bring about a cease-fire and 
then a pullback, in Kashmir, before this conflict takes another escalating step.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Mr. President, we have every hope for your success.

BARTLET
You do.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
However, I’ve been instructed by Beijing to inform you that under no circumstances 
will China allow India’s aggression against Kashmir, as it only intensifies the threat 
of Indian aggressors on our own border.

LEO
David? Are you suggesting that China might intervene?

CHINESE AMBASSADOR
The Indians must be stopped, Leo. Of course China would like to see a peaceful solution. 
But we are prepared to use whatever force is necessary.

BARTLET
Well, this just keeps getting better and better.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. OUTSIDE SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Mandy catches Sam as he’s leaving his office.

MANDY
Did you speak to him?

SAM
Toby?

MANDY
Yes.

SAM
I did.

MANDY
And?

SAM
Mandy, uh...

MANDY
He didn’t go for it.

SAM
It wasn’t the reaction you were hoping for.

MANDY
Did you tell him about education and women’s issues?

SAM
Yes.

MANDY
Did you tell him enthusiastically?

SAM
Yes.

MANDY
Did you tell him about...?

SAM
I told him everything there is to tell him. He did not warm to the idea.

JOSH
Let’s go.

SAM
I’m ready.

MANDY
Talk to him.

SAM
I will.

MANDY
Do it enthusiastically.

SAM
Okay.

JOSH
Talk to me about what?

SAM
Mandy wants to take on Mike Brace as a client.

JOSH
Is there another Mike Brace?

SAM
Not in the House of Representatives, no.

JOSH
She understands he’s a Republican right?

SAM
Yeah, she’s a pretty bright girl.

JOSH
Oh, I’m gonna kill her.

SAM
So you’re saying no way?

JOSH
Yeah, that’s a big 10-4.

SAM
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
The PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR is seated when Bartlet and Leo enter. There are two Pakistani
aides present as well.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Mr. President.

BARTLET
You know Leo McGarry?

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Yes sir.

LEO
Good to see you again.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Terrible circumstances.

BARTLET
Please, sit down. We’ve been trying to phone your Prime Minister without any luck. 
Can you help us out there?

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
The Prime Minister, naturally, is preoccupied organizing our response to this latest 
unprovoked aggression by India, but I’ll do my best to help you.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador, I stood at a podium this morning, and I publicly condemned the incursion 
by Indian forces.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
We felt your condemnation could have been stronger.

BARTLET
My condemnation might have been stronger if my State Department didn’t feel that the 
Indian action was provoked.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
I think you’re being misinformed, Mr. President.

BARTLET
You deny there has been Pakistani movement in the Neutral Zone?

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
The people of Kashmir are simply demanding their human rights guaranteed by the U.N. 
Charter for Self Determination. The unrest of the past few months is entirely the 
result of the cruel oppression of a defenseless people.

LEO
The people the President’s talking about aren’t defenseless, Mr. Ambassador. They’re 
carrying the M-16s we sold them.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Mr. McGarry...

BARTLET
Hang on. Look. The U.S. is committed to finding a reasonable solution to the dispute.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
With all due respect, Mr. President, it is not a dispute, but an illegal occupation by 
the Indian state.

BARTLET
Whatever the language, I know that you will agree with me that we have to find a way 
for these two countries to exist together in a global community.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
That sounds very nice, Mr. President, but the people of Pakistan do not wish to exist 
in a global community with criminals.

BARTLET
I’d imagine the Indian ambassador is going to say roughly the same thing about you.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Be that as it may.

BARTLET
Yes. [standing] Thank you for coming.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR
Yes, Mr. President.

BARTLET
[shaking hands with aides as they leave] Thank you.

CHARLIE
[enters] Mr. President?

BARTLET
I’ll take the Indian ambassador in the Oval Office.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
And then if you could just ask the Secret Service to step in and kill me, please.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

Leo and Bartlet head across the hall to THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Zoey just walked right up to him and asked him out.

LEO
She’s a very outgoing girl.

BARTLET
See, but a dungeon would have put an end to that.

LEO
We learn these lessons the hard way.

BARTLET
I think you’re trying to cover up the fact that you’re enjoying this.

LEO
I’m not trying to cover it up at all.

BARTLET
I’m a father in pain.

LEO
Well, really you’re just a pain.

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO
Got a racial problem?

BARTLET
A racial problem?

LEO
It’s okay to admit it.

BARTLET
I don’t!

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
I don’t have a racial problem.

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
I’m Spencer Tracy at the end of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
Racial problem!

LEO
I’m just saying...

BARTLET
My problem is not that she’s white, he’s black, it’s that she’s a girl and he’s not. 
To say nothing of he’s older than she is.

LEO
She’s 19. He’s 21.

BARTLET
Yeah, but a guy learns a lot in those two years.

LEO
Okay.

BARTLET
Tracy was good in that movie.

LEO
Yeah.

Charlie shows in the INDIAN AMBASSADOR.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Thank you.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
You look well, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I was looking a lot better before your country breached about fourteen cease-fire 
conditions without so much as a phone call, so let’s sit down and talk. Charlie, 
please close the door.

Charlie exits.

CUT TO: INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
Claypool is seated opposite Josh and Sam, continuing the deposition. There are 
several other people in the room.

CLAYPOOL
And you didn’t make a single note?

JOSH
No.

CLAYPOOL
You’re asking me to believe...

JOSH
This is the seventh lawsuit you’ve brought against the White House and the fourth time 
you’ve deposed me and demanded to see documents that don’t exist.

CLAYPOOL
In your investigation in which you wrote nothing down - and it’s nice to see that the 
White House is taking the matter so seriously - in your investigation did you find any 
evidence of staff drug use?

JOSH
No.

CLAYPOOL
I’d like to remind you that you’re under oath.

SAM
And I’d like to remind you that that’s the seventh time that you’ve reminded him since 
he sat down.

CLAYPOOL
Are there alcoholics working in the White House?

JOSH
I would imagine that there are.

CLAYPOOL
You would imagine?

JOSH
Statistics suggest...

CLAYPOOL
Do you know for sure that there are?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
What are their names?

JOSH
What, are you crazy?

CLAYPOOL
You don’t think the public has the right to know?

JOSH
Drinking isn’t against the law.

CLAYPOOL
I’m speaking of a higher standard.

SAM
He’s not going to tell you the names of people he knows to be alcoholics, move on.

CLAYPOOL
Is Leo McGarry an alcoholic?

JOSH
I won’t answer that.

CLAYPOOL
Has he received treatment at a facility for alcoholism?

JOSH
I won’t answer that.

CLAYPOOL
Has he received treatment at a facility for Valium addiction?

SAM
He’s not obligated to answer that question. 

CLAYPOOL
Why not?

SAM
It’s irrelevant to your cause of action under the Freedom of Information Act in which 
you are seeking any and all documents relating to Joshua Lyman’s investigation of 
illegal drug use in the White House. We go see the judge right now, she’ll sustain 
my objection.

CLAYPOOL
Mr. Lyman, in the course of your investigation, did you look at Secret Service files 
of the people you were investigating?

JOSH
There was no investigation.

CLAYPOOL
Did you look at any Secret Service files?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Including Leo McGarry’s?

JOSH
Yes.

CLAYPOOL
Now, I have a record here which you would have had access to as well. It says...

JOSH
How did you get that?

CLAYPOOL
It says Leo McGarry spent twenty-eight days in an alcohol and substance abuse treatment 
center called Sierra Tucson.

JOSH
This is a piece of paper obtained illegally.

CLAYPOOL
That’s my problem. Your problem is to answer this question. In your investigation of 
Leo McGarry, did you discover that he was not only treated for alcohol addiction, he 
was treated for Valium addiction as well? Now, should we take that question to the 
judge and ask her about relevancy?

SAM
We’re going to postpone this deposition.

CLAYPOOL
I’m not nearly finished.

SAM
We’re postponing. You have a problem with it, cite us for contempt.

Sam and Josh rise to leave. Claypool rises and pursues them.

CLAYPOOL
I would think that you would be concerned with your own reputations. And the notion 
of you standing up for a man so egregiously unqualified...

Josh suddenly turns on Claypool and pushes him up against the wall. Sam quickly turns 
back into the room.

SAM
Josh!

Josh recovers himself.

SAM 
Go.

JOSH leaves the room.

SAM
[to Claypool] You’re a cheap hack. And if you come after Leo I’m gonna bust you like 
a piñata.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet, Leo, and the Indian ambassador are in mid-conversation.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Your frustration, Mr. President, is because you can no longer control us with the threat 
of economic sanctions.

BARTLET
My frustration, Mr. Ambassador, is that both you and the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons 
and a tendency to get cranky.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
India must and will be a nuclear power, Mr. President. That way, we’ll never be dictated 
to again.

BARTLET
Well, it was nice spending this time with you.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Thank you Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

LEO
[showing out the ambassador] Thank you.

BARTLET
Every time he talks about colonial Western imperialism, I always want to remind him 
that the United States is also a revolutionary country that threw off its colonial masters.

LEO
Why don’t you?

BARTLET
I keep forgetting.

CHARLIE
[sticks his head in] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Is he here?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Send him in please.

LEO
Oh, God help me.

LORD JOHN MARBURY enters, looking disheveled.

BARTLET
John!

MARBURY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you for coming. How was your flight?

MARBURY
Intoxicating.

LEO
Oh, I see.

MARBURY
[to Leo] Allow me to present myself, Lord John Marbury, I was summoned by your President.

LEO
Yes. We’ve met, ten or twelve times. I’m Leo McGarry.

MARBURY
I thought you were the butler.

LEO
No, I’m the White House Chief of Staff.

MARBURY
Nonetheless, would you have something with which to light my cigarette?

LEO
Oh, I’m afraid we don’t allow smoking in this part of the world.

MARBURY
Really? 

LEO
Yes sir.

MARBURY
In this part over here, we encourage it.

LEO
Sir.

MARBURY
It’s “Your Lordship,” as a matter of fact, but it couldn’t possibly make the least 
difference. So, tell me, how can I be of service to you? If it’s within my power to 
give, you shall have it.

BARTLET
We need your take on the situation, John.

MARBURY
What is your “take” on the situation?

BARTLET
The world is coming apart at the seams.

MARBURY
Well, then... [hands his coat to Leo, imperiously] ...thank God you sent for me!

LEO
Yes.
 
FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. C.J.’S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is talking on the phone.

C.J.
[into the phone] -- the Earl of Sherbourne, he is the great great grandson of a former 
Viceroy and for thirteen years served as the Queen’s minister to either India or 
Pakistan. Lord Marbury is here to council the President, and if you think this is 
all starting to sound like a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, I don’t blame you a bit. 

Carol and Toby appear in the doorway.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J.
[into the phone] Thank you. [to Carol] Yes.

CAROL
Toby’s here.

C.J.
Okay. [To Toby] Hello.

TOBY
I feel that I didn’t have the opportunity to properly articulate my argument.

C.J.
Either I’m a trusted member of the communications staff or I’m not, Toby, what was your 
argument?

TOBY
That was my argument.

C.J.
That wasn’t your argument.

TOBY
[sitting on the couch] It was my argument a little while ago, when I was arguing in my head.

C.J.
Are you apologizing?

TOBY
Yes. [long pause]

C.J.
Well?

TOBY
What?

C.J.
Apologize!

TOBY
[peevishly] I’m sorry!

C.J.
God!

TOBY
I was trying to do it nicer than that.

C.J.
[sitting next to him on the couch] Whose idea was it?

TOBY
Mine.

C.J.
You were the one who said “India’s invaded Pakistan, let’s not tell C.J.?”

TOBY
I didn’t say it like that.

C.J.
Well, how’d you say it?

TOBY
I said it nicer.

Toby looks at C.J. and gives her a very small smile.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Josh is arriving back in the office. Donna greets him.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Hi, Donna.

DONNA
I didn’t expect you back so soon.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Did everything go okay?

JOSH
[as she takes his coat] No, actually, it didn’t. Thanks.

Toby and C.J. are coming out of her office and meet Josh in the hallway heading for 
his office.

TOBY
You’re back.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Toby apologized to me.

JOSH
Listen...

C.J.
In his way.

TOBY
C.J....

JOSH
Listen, I need to tell you guys something.

They all go into Josh’s office.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - DAY
Sam is coming back to his office. He walks past a television monitor showing soldiers 
fighting in Kashmir, sits at his desk, and stares into space. Mandy comes to his door.

MANDY
Sam? [No response.] Sam?

SAM
Yeah?

MANDY
Did you talk to him?

SAM
What?

MANDY
Did you talk to him?

SAM
It’s a bad idea, Mandy.

MANDY
Did you tell him about...?

SAM
No.

MANDY
I thought that you were the champion of bipartisan cooperation, and the spirit of...

SAM
Leo’s in trouble. You’re a political consultant. Your job isn’t to end the fight, it’s 
to win it! Now you can work for us or you can work for them, but you can’t do both.

Josh, Toby, and C.J. appear in the doorway.

JOSH
Sam?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Let’s go.

Josh, Sam, Toby, and C.J. leave.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet, Leo and Marbury are in the midst of a conversation.

LEO
Oh, I think that’s nonsense.

MARBURY
Oh, do you?

LEO
Yes. I think you’re dramatically over-estimating the possibility of escalation beyond 
the point we’re at now.

MARBURY
Interesting.

LEO
Thank you.

MARBURY
What is your name again?

LEO
All right.

MARBURY
Happily ensconced in the cocoon of your Cold War victory, you are woefully ignorant 
of the powerful historical agents in Asia. The global triumph of the economic free 
market has created an illusory assumption that the world is drawing itself closer 
together. Your Congress has been pathetically inept at halting the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in this region, and your intelligence gathering is weak. India and 
Pakistan have fought three wars in the half-century since they have gained their 
independence, with God knows how many skirmishes in between. It is about religion, 
and I can assure you, they do not share our fear of the bomb.

Charlie enters with a message and hands it to Lord Marbury.

MARBURY 
Oh, I have a telephone call. Mr. President, may I take it please in your foyer?

BARTLET
Yeah, go ahead.

MARBURY
Thank you. [leaves with Charlie]

LEO
[to Bartlet] I don’t even think the accent’s real.

BARTLET
I want to ask him to stay a little bit and help us out.

LEO
For how long?

BARTLET
You two are going to become good friends.

LEO
He thinks I’m the butler.

BARTLET
For the first couple of weeks, so did I.

There is a knock at the door and Margaret enters.

MARGARET
Excuse me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hello, Margaret.

LEO
What do you need?

Margaret whispers in Leo’s ear.

LEO
Yeah. [to Bartlet] Would you excuse me for a moment?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY
Josh, Toby, C.J., and Sam are gathered. Leo enters, followed by Margaret.

LEO
What’s going on?

JOSH
It didn’t go well. Claypool’s got a copy of your records from rehab. Either he got 
‘em from Lillienfield or the other way around. I was in a position where I was gonna 
perjure myself, so SAM ended the deposition. Claypool’s next step is to call a reporter, 
so I’m pretty sure you’re going to be read about this soon, so I wanted to ask you, 
does your family know?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
‘Cause if they don’t, Leo...

LEO
They know.

JOSH
And the President?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
You ready for this?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
Then we’re here for whatever you need. We just wanted to come in and tell you that.

Leo looks from one to the other of them.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is seated as Charlie enters.

BARTLET
Is he still on the phone?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

CHARLIE
Do you need anything?

BARTLET
[going to his desk] There’s a quote from Revelations I’m trying to remember.

CHARLIE
[following him] I can’t help you out there, sir.

BARTLET
It’s about a horse.

CHARLIE
I’ve never read Revelations.

BARTLET
Why not?

CHARLIE
Never got around to it.

BARTLET
Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it’s not 
‘cause you’re black.

CHARLIE
[sits] I didn’t think it was.

BARTLET
It’s not.

CHARLIE
I thought it was ‘cause I’m a guy.

BARTLET
It is.

CHARLIE
I understand.

BARTLET
Still, I want you to go out with her if that’s what you both want to do.

CHARLIE
I’d like to.

BARTLET
That’s fine.

CHARLIE
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Just remember these two things: She’s nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Also this - no kidding. You go out with Zoey, you’re gonna get your picture taken. 
There’s gonna be a lot of people not wild about the sight of you and the President’s 
daughter. You know what to do with the mail, right?

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[standing] All right. You keep your head up.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
Should have built a dungeon.

CHARLIE
Yes sir.

BARTLET
[now searching for something in his desk drawer] Revelations. It’s about a horse, 
and Death was riding on it maybe.

CHARLIE
Really, I haven’t read it, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Okay.

CHARLIE
Should I go check it out?

BARTLET
Yes, please.

CHARLIE
Okay.

BARTLET
Thank you, Charlie.

Bartlet finds what he’s been looking for in his desk drawer - a cigarette lighter. 
Leo, Josh, C.J., Sam, and Toby enter.

BARTLET
Ah, good, I want you all to meet John.

LEO
Mr. President, before Lord Fauntleroy...

BARTLET
Lord Marbury.

LEO
Whatever. Before he comes back in the room, I wanted to tell you that Josh’s deposition 
did not go well, and that the story will probably break soon.

BARTLET
How you doing?

LEO
I’m fine.

BARTLET
Don’t you ever forget the battles you’ve fought and won.

LEO
Yes sir.

MARBURY
[enters] I’m back... and I believe there are many more people in the room.

LEO
Excellent deducing, your Lordship.

MARBURY
Mr. President, the telephone call was from the British ambassador to the United Nations. 
He believes there’ll be a cease-fire resolution within a few hours.

BARTLET
That’s what I’d heard. But all they got was two weeks.

MARBURY 
It’s two weeks better than nothing.

BARTLET
John, I was hoping you’d stick around for a couple of days and help us out.

MARBURY
A few days, a few months, however long it takes is as long as I shall serve.

LEO
Well, let’s play it by ear.

MARBURY
You’re all frightened. As well you should be. Not since the Protestant-Catholic wars 
in the 16th century has Western society known anything remotely comparable to the 
subcontinent’s religious malevolence. To a lesser observer, the intensity of the 
emotional frenzy is so illogical as to border on mass psychosis. But, as has been 
said by kings and queens, I am not a lesser observer.

BARTLET
John, there’s a quote from Revelations...

MARBURY
“And I looked, and I beheld a pale horse, and the name that sat on him was Death, and 
Hell followed with him.”

BARTLET
Are you frightened, John?

MARBURY
Do you mean do I think we can stop a war in the next two weeks?

BARTLET
Yes.

MARBURY
Yes.

BARTLET
Good.

MARBURY
But -- 

Bartlet turns to him expectantly. Marbury takes a cigarette from his pocket.

MARBURY [cont.]
-- I shall require a light.

Marbury catches the lighter Bartlet has tossed him, smiles, and lights his cigarette.
