TEASER

FADE IN: INT. CONGRESS MEETING ROOM - DAY
We see Leo, sitting at a table, alone. A clock is ticking. 

LEO
Mike, come on in. 

MIKE CASPER
I was on the other side...

LEO
Yeah. Margaret, could you...? 

MARGARET
Yeah.

MIKE 
Lot of people out there. 

LEO
Yeah. So, listen, there were more threats? 

MIKE 
Seven churches in five Tennessee counties. 

LEO
How many guys do you have on the ground? 

MIKE 
We've got 25 and ATF is sending in a team. 

LEO
Has the Governor been briefed? 

MIKE 
Right now. 

LEO
All right, listen. I got to be here; I'm stuck with this thing. Will you stay with 
Josh today? 

MIKE
Yeah. 

MARGARET
[indicating cellphone] Josh. 

LEO
And can you do me a favor and get me a secure phone hookup so I can monitor this 
thing? All I've got is the cell. 

MIKE 
Good luck today. 

LEO
Go. [to phone] Josh. 

JOSH
New threats were made in Tennessee this morning. 

LEO
Mike Casper was just here. He's going to be with you today. 

JOSH
Good. 

LEO
You'll be all right? 

JOSH
Yeah. 

LEO
'Cause I got to be here all day. It's going to take all day. 

JOSH
Yeah, keep your head there, would you? Don't call during every break and check in. 
Keep your head there. 

LEO
I'll keep my head where I want. 

JOSH
Leo? 

LEO
Yeah. 

JOSH
There are ways. 

LEO
Don't start again. 

JOSH
There are ways to get the guy out of the room. 

LEO
Hey, I'll keep my head here. You keep your head there, hmm? 

JOSH
I used to do this for a living, Leo. The guy gets the floor for five minutes. I can 
get him out of the room. 

LEO
Don't help me. 

JOSH
I'm going to help you, 'cause you know why? 

LEO
'Cause you walk around with so much guilt about everybody you love dying that you're 
a compulsive fixer? 

JOSH
No, Leo, no. It's 'cause a guy is walking down the street and he falls into a hole, see. 

LEO
Yeah. 

JOSH
Yeah. 

LEO
It's my day, Josh. I got to take the hit. 

JOSH
Leo- 

LEO
I'll see you. 

JORDAN
They're waiting for us. 

LEO
You want to go and get breakfast or something? 

JORDAN
No. 

LEO
Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out. I love tomato juice. 

JORDAN
They're waiting for us, Leo. 

LEO
They can wait. 

JORDAN
No, they really can't. 

LEO
Yeah, they really can. Seven new threats on black churches; the Governor's coming up; 
we might have to federalize the Tennessee National Guard; and that's just the stuff 
I know about that's going to happen, and here I am today. 

JORDAN
You shouldn't be nervous. 

LEO
I swear to God, Jordan, the last thing I am right now is nervous. 

JORDAN
Let's go. 

LEO
[the press closes in] Did I win a Grammy for something? 

JORDAN
Were you nominated? 

LEO
No. 

JORDAN
That's ridiculous. 

LEO
Well, those things are so political. 

JORDAN
Leo, is there something you haven't told me? 

LEO
There's lots of things I haven't told you, Jordan. 

JORDAN
About today. 

INT. HOUSE HEARING ROOM - DAY, CONTINUOUS 

MARGARET
Leo? 

JORDAN
He can't take any calls right now. 

MARGARET
It's the President. 

LEO
Good morning, sir. 

BARTLET
[on phone] Listen, I don't care that much about your ass but if you need to perjure 
yourself to protect me you're going to damn well do it. 

LEO
Sir, this isn't a secure call, so I'm going to say to the 17 global intelligence 
agencies that are listening in that he was kidding just then. 

BARTLET
Whatever it is Josh does, you're going to let him do it. 

LEO
I don't need Josh- 

BARTLET
Yeah, yeah. How does she look to you? 

LEO
Who? 

BARTLET
Her. 

LEO
She looks good. 

BARTLET
What's she wearing? 

LEO
[to Jordan] What are you wearing? 

JORDAN
What does it matter? 

LEO
Why don't you ask the President that? 

JORDAN
A gray Armani suit. 

LEO
[into phone] Spandex. 

BARTLET
I like you and her. It's like a '50s screwball comedy 

LEO
You're like a '50s screwball- 

BARTLET
What was that? 

LEO
Nothing. We should do gifts and charitable donations tomorrow night. 

BARTLET
I'm not doing anything tomorrow night. 

LEO
What's tomorrow night? 

BARTLET
It's Christmas Eve. 

LEO
I forgot, and you don't work then, right? 

BARTLET
Yeah. Actually, nobody does. 

LEO
All right, the Governor is going to be there at noon but I'll be talking to you 
before then. 

BARTLET
You got about a thousand people in this building standing with you right now. 

LEO
I'll be back when I'm done. 

BARTLET
Okay. 

JORDAN
Leo. What's going on? 

CHARIMAN 
Will the first witness rise raise your right hand to God and swear the oath that's 
written in front of you? 

JORDAN
Leo. 

LEO
[to Jordan] It ain't nothing but a family thing. [to Committee] I solemnly swear that 
the testimony today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so 
help me God. 

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE 

FADE IN: INT. HOUSE HEARING ROOM - DAY 

CHAIRMAN
Would you state your full name, please? 

LEO
Leo Thomas McGarry. 

CHAIRMAN
And would you identify counsel, please? 

LEO
We've never met. 

JORDAN
Jordan Kendall, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN
Mr. McGarry, the Committee thanks you for your appearance today. Why are we here? What 
are we after? Many, if not most of us, were surprised by the President's announcement 
that he's been diagnosed with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis for seven years 
and never mentioned it while asking us to vote for him for President but more surprising 
still, if not stunning is that his medical condition could have been kept a secret from 
those campaign aides closest to him. In this age when the most minute details of a 
candidate's life are brought into the light in a business where secrets aren't kept 
secret very long this Committee would like to know, quite candidly how it was pulled off. 
Did people lie? Were people told to lie? Are people lying now? You'll be questioned by 
Majority Counsel then Minority Counsel then each member will have five minutes to 
question alternating back and forth between the majority and the minority. Mr. Calley. 

CLIFF
Mr. McGarry, I'm Clifford Calley. I'm the Majority Counsel. Good morning. 

LEO
Good morning. 

CLIFF
What is your current job title? 

LEO
White House Chief of Staff. 

CLIFF
And what's your previous job title? 

LEO
General Chairman, Bartlet for America. 

CLIFF
How long have you known the President? 

LEO
We met for the first time about 32 years ago, but I would say our friendship began 11 
years ago. 

CLIFF
You're the person in the White House who's known him the longest? 

LEO
No. The First Lady's known him the longest. 

CLIFF
Fair enough. Mr. McGarry, it was you who first approached Jed Bartlet about running for 
President, is that right? 

LEO
Yes. 

CLIFF
Where and when did that happen? 

LEO
Four years ago, last month, at the statehouse in Concord. 

CUT TO: INT. NEW HAMPSIRE STATE HOUSE, OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR - FLASHBACK - DAY
Allen and Alan are giving a very unsure presentation about why the state's slogan should 
be "It's what's new." Throughout, behind Jed, Leo is pacing outside the office, unseen. 

ALLEN
[whipping the cover off the posterboard, bearing the new design] "New Hampshire." 
"It's what's new!" 

BARTLET
[attention being interrupted from his reading] Huh? 

ALLEN
"New Hampshire. It's what's new." 

BARTLET
Thomas Hilton started a fishing village here in 1623, Allen. 

ALLEN
Th-That's the point, Governor. People think of us as a crusty New England relic and 
tourism's our second largest industry. 

BARTLET
Yeah. 

ALAN
The point is if we don't find a way to be fresh and new- 

ALLEN
While obviously still retaining our charm- 

ALAN
Yeah, we'll never be able to stem the falloff in revenue. 

BARTLET
And a slogan's going to do that? 

ALAN
Well, that's just the beginning. We've got an aggressive strategy. 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

ALAN
The Office of Travel and Tourism is going to run print ads throughout New England 
encouraging people to drive here and view the fall foliage. 

BARTLET
Oh, oh, slow down, you're going too fast. 

ALLEN
Oh, there's also our new toll-free number with up-to-the-minute reservation information. 
This is separate from the campaign we'll be doing for snowmobiling, which brings $367 
million into the state. 

BARTLET
$367 million in snowmobiling? 

ALLEN
That includes the $1.1 million in registration fees and $717,000 in gas taxes. 

BARTLET
[clearly joking] And the goggles... That includes the goggles? 

ALLEN
[deflated and guilty] I don't know. 

ALAN
I'm not sure. 

ALLEN
It must, if you...

BARTLET
Okay. Thanks, guys. [shouting] Mrs. Landingham! Thanks. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Speaking of crusty New England relics...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Governor, does it frustrate you to constantly aim for humor and yet miss so dramatically? 

BARTLET
Nah. Abbey wants to eat at Patsy's tonight. Would you let them know we're coming? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
What's next? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
That's all for the schedule but Leo McGarry is here and would like a minute. 

BARTLET
Leo's here? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mm-hmm. 

BARTLET
[yelling] Leo! 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'm happy to get him myself, as they do in a civilized world. 

BARTLET
Yeah, yeah. Hey. 

LEO
Hey, Governor. [reading sign] "New Hampshire. It's what's new"? 

BARTLET
Jenny and Mallory are okay? 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
What are you doing here? 

LEO
I don't know. What do you got? You got leaves. I came to look at the leaves. 

BARTLET
What are you doing...? 

LEO
I came to talk to you. 

BARTLET
Everything's okay? 

LEO
Yeah. 

BARTLET
Why didn't you call? 

LEO
'Cause you would've asked me what I wanted to talk to you about. 

BARTLET
Where are you staying? 

LEO
At the Marriott. 

BARTLET
What do you want to talk to me about? 

LEO
I've been thinking about getting back into politics. 

BARTLET
I think that's great, man. I think it's about time. You probably mean the House, but I 
think you should consider the Senate seat in Illinois in two years; I can help raise money. 

LEO
No, I wasn't thinking about the Senate. I was thinking about the White House. 

BARTLET
Hey, Leo, I swear to God there's no one I'd rather see in the Oval Office than you but 
if you run there's going to be a lot of discussion about Valium and Alcohol. I mean, 
it's going to come out; this is the world. 

LEO
Yeah. See, I wasn't thinking about me. 

BARTLET
Who? 

LEO
I've been walking around in a kind of daze for two weeks and everywhere I go...planes, 
trains, restaurants, meetings...I find myself scribbling something down. 

BARTLET
What? Leo takes a napkin out of his pocket, licks it, and sticks it on the posterboard 
easel. It reads "Bartlet for America." 

CUT TO: INT. HOUSE HEARING ROOM - PRESENT - DAY

RATHBURN
He never mentioned his health? 

LEO
No. 

RATHBURN
Not during the first meeting in his office? 

LEO
No. 

RATHBURN
Not during the second meeting at the Marriott? 

LEO
No. 

RATHBURN
Well, then, I'd like to ask you this-If he had told you about his condition would you 
still have thought it was a good idea that he run? 

LEO
I don't know. 

RATHBURN
Well, think about it and try answering. 

LEO
[covering his mic, and to Jordan] Listen, I'm going to talk a little and you nod and 
talk a little bit back to me. 

JORDAN
What are you doing? 

LEO
That's good. 

JORDAN
I'm really asking you. 

LEO
I think Rathburn's being a little snotty I think he's going to have to wait and I think 
he's going to have to wait with the camera on me. 

RATHBURN
Mr. McGarry. 

LEO
One second, please. [to Jordan] Listen, what are you doing for lunch? 

JORDAN
I don't know. 

LEO
Because I thought maybe we could have lunch or something. 

JORDAN
Leo, you've got to answer the question. 

LEO
[to Committee] Congressman, could you repeat the question, please? 

RATHBURN
If Jed Bartlet had told you about his health either at the first meeting or the second 
meeting would you still have thought it was a good idea for him to run? 

LEO
Yeah, I don't know. 

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - DAY

DONNA
Mike? 

MIKE
Yeah? 

DONNA
Come on back.

MIKE 
Thanks. Listen, churches are burning down. Otherwise, I'd be hitting on you. 

DONNA
I appreciate that. 

MIKE 
Sure. Maybe when it's a better time. 

JOSH
[coming down the hall] Let's go. 

MIKE 
Where are we going? 

JOSH
17-month investigation, 34 black churches. How can there be no evidence of a conspiracy? 

MIKE
I don't know. It's probably because we're stupid. 

JOSH
Mike- 

MIKE 
The FBI could invent a pattern but then that would be against the law. 

JOSH
Yeah.

MIKE
Okay? 

JOSH
You met with Leo this morning? 

MIKE 
Yeah. Listen, that was big for me. I don't brief the White House Chief of Staff. 

JOSH
All right, well, let's listen in on this meeting for a minute. 

MIKE 
Hang on. This wall is curved. 

JOSH
Yeah. Let's go. 

MIKE 
I don't have to go in there. I can wait out here. 

JOSH
Charlie. 

CHARLIE
Yeah. 

JOSH
Let's go. 

Josh and Mike go inside THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Well, the phone calls have been coming all morning, Governor. You should know that Algiss 
Skyler called. 

GOVERNOR
Skyler wants you to call up the Guard? 

BARTLET
Skyler wants to know why the hell you haven't. 

GOVERNOR
Because local law enforcement is doing plenty. 

BARTLET
Was Eisenhower wrong in '57? Kennedy in '61? 

GOVERNOR
This is a different situation. 

BARTLET
We don't know what the situation is, do we, Josh? 

JOSH
No, sir. Mr. President, this is Special Agent Mike Casper who's acting as the FBI's White 
House liaison during this situation. 

BARTLET
Do we know what's going on, Agent Casper? 

MIKE
No, sir. 

BARTLET
Edward, so far the churches have been empty. There have been no fatalities. But tomorrow 
night's Christmas Eve. They're going to be packed. So why shouldn't I send troops in? 

GOVERNOR
Because, due respect, Mr. President but you do it without my consent and it's a clear 
violation of State's rights and you would have said the same thing when you were the 
Governor of New Hampshire. 

BARTLET
This doesn't happen in New Hampshire. 

GOVERNOR
You got a pretty big black population in New Hampshire, do you? 

BARTLET
We'll meet again this afternoon. Thank you, Governor. 

GOVERNOR
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
Josh, stick around. 

JOSH
Yes, sir. 

MIKE
I'll be in the bullpen. 

BARTLET
So, what have you got cooking? 

JOSH
I'm sorry? 

BARTLET
I said, what have you got cooking? 

JOSH
I don't understand. 

BARTLET
Yes, you do. I know what happened at the third debate. He told me. I know what's going to 
happen this afternoon. What are you going to do? Are you going to try and get Gibson out 
of the room when it's his turn to question? 

JOSH
I don't think you and I should discuss it, sir. 

CONGRESSWOMAN [on TV] 
The red light is on, so I will yield the floor...

BARTLET
Where are we? 

CHARLIE
Dearborn will be next. 

CHAIRMAN
...Dearborn, you have five minutes. 

DEARBORN
Mr. McGarry, I would like to use my time to talk about Edith Wilson. 

BARTLET
Abbey's about to get spanked. Guys, the things we do to women. My wife's a world-class 
scientist. 

DEARBORN
Do you know who Edith Wilson was? 

LEO
Edith Wilson was Edith Galt before she became the second wife of Woodrow Wilson. 

DEARBORN
And with the help of her doctors she ran this country for months while her husband was 
incapacitated by a stroke. 

LEO
Yes. 

DEARBORN
Do you believe that the President having a stroke falls within the scope of the 25th 
Amendment? 

JORDAN
Excuse me, but with the Wilsons being dead for 80 years I don't believe it falls within 
the scope of this hearing. 

DEARBORN
Abbey Bartlet knew of her husband's condition. 

LEO
Yes. 

DEARBORN
And she kept it to herself. 

LEO
Well, I don't know who she kept it to, Congressman. 

DEARBORN
She didn't tell you. 

LEO
No. 

DEARBORN
Or anyone else in the high command of the Bartlet campaign? You're smiling. 

LEO
Yes, sir. 

DEARBORN
Why? 

LEO
Because at this point there wasn't much of a high command. All we'd done is show a strong 
third in Iowa. We were working out of storefront. 

CUT TO: INT. STOREFRONT - FLASHBACK - DAY 
Toby and C.J. are throwing a basketball back and forth to each other.

TOBY
You got to pop the ball. You got to pop it. 

C.J.
I'm popping it. 

TOBY
No, you're not. 

SAM
So my feeling- 

TOBY
Yeah? 

SAM
Is that we're fine playing this song in South Carolina. 

C.J.
I agree. 

TOBY
Pop it. 

SAM
As long as all he's doing is running against Wiley it's fine that he doesn't seem like a 
real candidate. 

TOBY
It's when Wiley drops out and he's running against Hoynes. 

SAM
Right. They'll cover us all the way to South Dakota. Suddenly, we don't want to be quaint 
anymore. People want to know "Is this guy for real?" 

SAM
We got to show them we're an honest-to-God alternative. We got to show them we're big time. 

Sam claps and holds out his hands for C.J. to throw him the ball. C.J. turns towards Sam 
and throws the ball past him and through the window behind him. C.J. gawks at the hole in 
the window.

C.J. 
Can we get an intern over here? 

SAM
What about this. A series of major, national policy addresses. We work with Josh; we pick 
three issues. 

TOBY
Yeah, and we should start projecting the image that he thinks he's for real. 

C.J.
We'll release his tax returns, put all his stocks in a blind trust. 

SAM
You know what else? 

TOBY
Yeah. 

SAM
He should take a physical. 

C.J.
Absolutely. He's got ten years on Hoynes. We should release a medical report. 

TOBY
I'll take it to Leo. 

SAM
Okay, guys, let's go. Let's be working. Somebody want to get the ball?

FADE TO: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
A large flag outside the headquarters flaps in the breeze. It's now late evening. A light snow 
is falling. Bartlet and Abbey walk side by side down the front steps of the building and along 
the street. A police car is parked a few blocks away, waiting for them, lights flashing.

ABBEY
I like some of these new people. I'm gonna miss them.

BARTLET
Yeah.

ABBEY
[chuckles softly] Josh Lyman's special. Sam Seaborn's very funny.

BARTLET
Which one's he?

ABBEY
The young one.

BARTLET
They're all young.

ABBEY
Mmm...

BARTLET
Listen, they want me to do some things before South Dakota.

ABBEY
[long pause] South Carolina's next.

BARTLET
Yeah, we're lookin' past that.

ABBEY
What do they want you to do?

They reach the car. A police officer opens the door to the back seat. Abbey turns to look 
at her husband.

BARTLET
Full financial disclosure...

ABBEY
I have no problem with that...

BARTLET
They want me to take a physical. 

She stares at him, a tiny glint of concern in her eyes.

BARTLET
What's a physical right now gonna show?

ABBEY
[trying to act casual] It'll, uh... Nothing... Um... You're in remission.

BARTLET
[shakes his head] I'm not lying to anybody, Abbey. I'm taking a physical - a physical which 
I'm under no legal obligation to take. I'm doing it voluntarily.

ABBEY
[nods, still looks concerned] Yeah.

BARTLET
Now is when people are listening. I'll make my speeches, get whooped on Super Tuesday, 
and we'll all go home.

Abbey smiles at him and he leans forward to kiss her. She gets in the car. He closes the door 
for her. The officer starts the engine and drives away. Bartlet stands there, hands in his 
coat pockets, watching her go.

DEARBORN [VO]
We're headed for South Carolina. We're planning for South Dakota. And Mrs. Bartlet - excuse me, 
Dr. Bartlet - has yet to mention to anyone that her husband has multiple sclerosis.

FADE TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE, OUTER OVAL OFFICE - PRESENT
Bartlet is watching the hearing on the TV near Charlie's desk.

BARTLET
[softly, with regret] The things we do to women.

BRUNO
[on TV] The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Buchanan.

Bartlet puts his reading glasses in his jacket pocket and goes outside through the French doors.

BUCHANAN 
[on TV] Mr. Chairman, with your permission, I'd like to skip any statement and move right 
into my questioning.

BRUNO
[on TV] The chair thanks the Gentleman for his consideration.

BUCHANAN 
[on TV] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAYS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS BULLPEN - DAY
Present day. Christmas lights are hanging throughout the Bullpen. Several TVs, perched on 
top of the filing cabinets, are tuned to the hearings, the sounds of which fill the hallway. 
Aides are bustling around Sam, who's getting some coffee. Josh walks up to him.

JOSH
Listen...

SAM
They're coming back from the break.

JOSH
[sighs] Yeah.

They walk down the hall. Josh begins to say something but he stops when Sam keeps talking.

SAM
You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about when we threw that basketball 
through the window of the first campaign headquarters in Manchester.

JOSH
[distracted] I wasn't there. I heard about it.

SAM
You weren't throwing the ball around with us?

JOSH
It was you, Toby, and C.J.

SAM
[chuckles, smiles to himself] What that must've looked like from the point of view of 
someone walking down the sidewalk...

JOSH
I need somebody in the steel lobby to speak to Darren Gibson right away - sometime toward 
the end of this hour.

SAM
[suddenly all business] Jim Jericho.

They walk in SAM'S OFFICE.

JOSH
Jim Jericho's who I had. He had to leave town. His wife is sick. Who else do we have? 
One of our people?

Sam is standing behind his desk, facing Josh.

SAM
Nick Grindell. 

Josh shakes his head, sighs, and looks at the floor.

SAM
Well, I'll get to somebody. What's this about?

JOSH
[quickly glances up at Sam] Nothing. [turns to leave, rubbing his forehead]

SAM
It's not about nothin'. You want Gibson out of the room.

JOSH
[standing in the doorway, turns to look at Sam] I'd like 'em all out of the room. 
[starts walking away again]

SAM
Josh. [Josh turns to look at him. Pause] What's Gibson got?

JOSH
[stares at Sam for several long moments] You'll get a guy for me?

SAM
[stares, nods] Yeah.

Josh turns and walks away. Sam sets his coffee down and sits at his desk. He opens a drawer, 
pulls out a thick address book, and flips through the pages which contain an uncharacteristic 
amount of messy scribbling. The TV next to his desk is tuned to the hearings. The Chairman 
of the Committee, CONGRESSMAN JOSEPH "PHIL" Bruno, gavels the committee back into session.

BRUNO
[on TV] I would like our ten-minute breaks to be closer to fifteen minutes than they are 
to a half hour...

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY

BRUNO [cont.]
...and, with that, the Chair recognizes the Gentleman from Pennsylvania.

CONGRESSMAN ERICKSON
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to complement you on your leadership of this committee. 

Bruno nods and silently mouths "Thank you" to Erickson. Erickson's hands are clasped in front 
of him, his tone a bit smug.

ERICKSON
Now, Mr. McGarry. You're familiar, are you not, with Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the 
U.S. Constitution?

Leo and Jordan stare blankly at Erickson. Leo pauses, then places his hand over his microphone 
and slowly turns toward Jordan. Jordan turns her microphone away from herself and leans toward Leo. 
They keep their voices low, whispering.

LEO
We're gonna have to do this again.

JORDAN
He's being snotty?

LEO
Yeah.

Seated among the committee members, Cliff sighs and tries not to look annoyed.

LEO
So... I was thinking maybe... you know... dinner...

JORDAN
[annoyed] Listen to me. I don't like this. You pay me six hundred and fifty dollars an hour. 
You tell me everything.

LEO
[hint of a devilish smile] Well, what do I have to pay to only tell you some things?

JORDAN
I don't know. But you have to pay it to another lawyer.

LEO
So what are you saying about dinner?

JORDAN
I'm not kidding around.

Leo looks at her for a few more moments, then slowly turns back toward the committee. He removes 
his hand from the microphone and leans toward it to speak.

LEO
Yes, I am.

ERICKSON
It says if something happens to the President then the Vice-President will assume his duties.

LEO
No, it says the Vice President assumes his duties if the President dies. Short of that, 
impeachment, or the 25th Amendment being invoked, the Vice President stays the Vice President.

ERICKSON
Who picked John Hoynes to be the running mate on the ticket?

LEO
The President did.

ERICKSON
Did he have any help?

LEO
Yes.

ERICKSON
Do you think the people who weighed in on the decision might have benefited from knowing about 
the President's health condition?

LEO
I don't see how. No.

ERICKSON
Well, with the possibility that the President might die in office...

LEO
Hold it.

ERICKSON
...a greater possibility with this President...

LEO
[emphatically] No, sir. That isn't true. MS isn't fatal. And while on national television, it is 
criminal to imply otherwise in an effort to score some cheap points. [pause] You owe an apology

ERICKSON
Mr. McGarry, I...

LEO
Finally, the President chose his running mate using the only yardstick that means anything: 
ability to assume the duties of the Presidency. And with John Hoynes, we got our man. 
And the Vice President was immediately told of the President's condition.

FADE TO: INT. PRESIDENTIAL HOTEL SUITE AT THE CONVENTION - FLASHBACK
The suite is large, with several separate areas, including a seating area with sofas. 
In the entryway, a TV is broadcasting MSNBC news coverage from the convention floor. 
The sound of cheers and applause mingles with the news anchor's voice.

NEWS ANCHOR [on TV]
I can tell you that when Jed Bartlet takes this stage 72 hours from now, these delegates are 
gonna go absolutely crazy.

Various aides - including Toby, Josh, Sam, and C.J. - are milling around by the sofas along 
with Bartlet and Leo. Abbey is getting coffee from a table near the TV. She smiles at an aide 
and walks across the room.

BARTLET
Toby?

TOBY
[walks toward Bartlet] Yeah.

BARTLET
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah.

BARTLET
Sam?

SAM
[smiles] Yeah. I think so.

BARTLET
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah.

BARTLET
[turns to look at Leo] All right, let's do it.

LEO
All right.

Leo walks toward the door. Abbey catches her husband's eye as she moves to stand where Leo was 
standing moments before. Bartlet is holding a mug of coffee, looking rather calm. In contrast, 
Abbey appears a little tense - she's wringing her hands and looks somewhat worried - although 
she's trying not to show it. Leo opens the door. John Hoynes is standing in the hallway talking 
with several aides.

LEO
John?

Hoynes looks over at Leo, then walks into the suite and shakes Leo's hand.

HOYNES
Leo.

Leo quietly closes the door and watches as Hoynes greets Abbey, who has banished the tension 
from her face. They embrace formally. He kisses her on the cheek.

HOYNES
Hello, Abbey.

ABBEY
Hello, John.

BARTLET
[smiles] Senator. 

Bartlet and Hoynes shake hands.

HOYNES
Good evening.

BARTLET
I'd like you to be the Vice-President.

Hoynes' expression goes from amiable smile to shock. He and Bartlet stare at each other 
silently for a few moments.

BARTLET
Why don't you sit with Abbey and me for a few minutes. [turns to aides] Can I have the 
room, please?

As the staff quickly take their leave, Bartlet walks over to a table on the other side of 
the suite. He pours himself another cup of coffee.

BARTLET
[to Hoynes] You want anything? Coffee or anything?

Hoynes, his hands in his pockets, walks slowly toward Bartlet.

HOYNES
Ah... no.

On yet another TV, this one in a corner, crowds on the convention floor can be heard chanting 
"Bartlet! Bartlet!" Hoynes glances over at the TV. Abbey finally joins them but stands a bit 
off to one side. Again, she looks a bit nervous and distracted as she fidgets with her wedding 
ring and watches the two men talk.

BARTLET
You ran a good campaign. [pause] You're a young man. You'll be back.

HOYNES
[nods] Thank you.

Bartlet finishes getting his coffee and walks back over to the sofas. Hoynes and Abbey join him 
as the last of the aides leaves and the door to the hall finally closes. Bartlet and Hoynes sit 
down across from each other. Abbey remains standing off to one side.

BARTLET
There's something you need to know. It's why I asked everyone to leave the room. 
[short pause] A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a relapsing remitting course of MS.

HOYNES
[confused] I'm sorry?

BARTLET
Multiple sclerosis. 

Hoynes, stunned, glances over at Abbey with a vaguely accusatory expression on his face. Bartlet 
looks over at her, too. She meets Hoynes' gaze. She reveals very little, says nothing, but her 
expression is grave.

HOYNES
[to Bartlet] Did you just tell me that you have MS?

BARTLET
Yeah.

HOYNES
Which you never mentioned during the campaign. 

Bartlet shakes his head. Hoynes raises an eyebrow and sighs heavily.

BARTLET
I told you because it's something you're gonna need to know. But also because I wanted to show 
that I trust you.

HOYNES
[slight edge to his voice] Oh, you do?

BARTLET
[unfazed] Yeah.

HOYNES
[leans forward] That's supposed to be me accepting the nomination Thursday night. But I suppose 
your trusting me is consolation prize enough.

BARTLET
[doesn't flinch, pauses] Well, what do you say?

Hoynes shrugs his shoulders, sighs, and stands up.

HOYNES
I'd like to think about it... for a few...

BARTLET
[stands] I'd like your answer now, John.

They stare at each other for several long moments, the tension rising.

HOYNES
You'll have it when I give it, Jed.

Hoynes turns and leaves, almost slamming the door on his way out. Bartlet watches him go. 
Abbey stares at her husband. She doesn't speak; she barely moves. Her expression is a 
mixture of concern and disbelief. Bartlet stands very still, not meeting her gaze, his 
hands in his pockets. In contrast to their mutual silence, a TV mounted in the wall behind 
Bartlet is broadcasting boisterous images from the convention floor. Finally, Bartlet 
reluctantly meets his wife's gaze - only for a moment - and then he walks toward the door, 
looking frustrated and perhaps a little upset, since his voice breaks slightly when he speaks.

BARTLET
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

Slowly, Abbey turns to watch him leave. She fidgets with her wedding ring and lets the shock 
and worry wash over her face.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

JOSH
If you could please give him that message as soon as he gets in or, you know, when he returns 
the page. Cindy, if I could tell you what it's regarding I'd have told you. Sorry. Thank you. 

DONNA
They want you. 

JOSH
Where have you been? 

DONNA
You sent me to the Hill. 

JOSH
Has Sam called? 

DONNA
No. 

JOSH
He didn't maybe drop off a piece of paper with a name on it? 

DONNA
No. They want you in the Mural Room. 

JOSH
Okay. 

Mike comes up the HALLWAY.

MIKE
Josh? 

JOSH
Where have you been? 

MIKE 
We got it. 

JOSH
President's going to make a decision right now. We got to... What? 

MIKE 
We got it. 

JOSH
What do you mean? 

MIKE 
Gilbert Murdock, a 17-year-old high school dropout was pulled over outside Chattanooga for 
a failing left brake light. When the officers approached his car he sped off and led them 
in high pursuit. 

JOSH
Why? 

MIKE 
'Cause he thought he was being pulled over for planning to make a Molotov cocktail. 

JOSH
Why? 

MIKE 
'Cause he was planning to make a Molotov cocktail. 

JOSH
Did he name friends? 

MIKE 
He was a tough nut to crack. Took almost 20 minutes. 

JOSH
We got ourselves a conspiracy. 

MIKE 
Yeah. 

JOSH
Let's go. 

MIKE 
Where? 

JOSH
To brief the President.

MIKE 
No. The Director will brief the President. 

JOSH
Mike, that's your task force out there. The only reason you're not out there with them is 
'cause-- I don't know-- 'cause you're a woman or something. 

MIKE 
I am temporarily desk-assigned for health reasons-- a decision I appealed vigorously. 

JOSH
Let's go. 

MIKE 
We don't take curtain calls. 

JOSH
You'll take a handshake. Let's go.

They go inside THE MURAL ROOM.

SKYLER
Of course there's a legal basis. Religious freedom is a civil right. The Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 raises these threats to a federal level. 

GOVERNOR
Credible threats, and no one in this room's trying to take away your civil rights. 

SKYLER
A sin of omission by any other name. 

JOSH
Mr. President? 

BARTLET
Yeah? 

JOSH
Your decision just got a lot easier. 

BARTLET
Tell me. 

MIKE
Sir, the FBI's ready to call this a credible threat. We have one of the conspirators in 
custody. 

BARTLET
Conspirators?

MIKE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
All right. Here come the Tennessee Volunteers. Reverend, have the pastors encourage the 
women to bake those guys something nice. They're all spending Christmas Eve where they 
don't want to be. Ed, you get to be a hero to the blacks in your state. Anybody in your 
state doesn't like it the FBI is calling the shots. What could you do? Anything else? 

SKYLER 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

GOVERNOR
Thank you, sir. 

BARTLET
I'm sorry. I've forgotten your name. 

MIKE 
Michael Casper. 

BARTLET
How'd you get him? 

MIKE
He was pulled over for a bad brake light and he thought it was something else. 

BARTLET
A two-year investigation gets its first crack from a broken taillight.

MIKE 
In 13 years with the Bureau I've discovered that there's no amount of money, manpower or 
knowledge than can equal the person you're looking for being stupid. 

BARTLET
God, well, some of the stupidest criminals in the world are working right here in America. 
I've always been very proud of that. 

MIKE
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET
Thank you, Agent Casper. 

MIKE 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET
So, what's going on? 

JOSH
I got to call him and tell him, you know- 

BARTLET
It's not going to happen? 

JOSH
I don't think so. 

BARTLET
It was a long shot, anyway. Look, I wanted to see him spared this but Leo's made out of 
leather. His face has a map of the world on it. Leo comes back. 

JOSH
Okay. 

BARTLET
All right.

Josh leaves.

BARTLET
Damn it.

REP. [on TV] 
At no point did he lie? 

LEO
No. 

REP 
And at no point did you lie? 

LEO
No. 

REP
At no point did he encourage others to lie? 

LEO
No. 

REP
And at no point has he been unable to discharge his duties? 

LEO
No. 

REP
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan Mr. Gibson, for five minutes. 

GIBSON
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Two years ago, January the President collapsed in the Oval Office. 
Is that correct? 

LEO
I'm not sure what the medical term would be. 

GIBSON
He involuntarily fell to the ground. 

LEO
Yes. 

GIBSON
Will Minority Counsel stipulate that we can call that collapsing? Let the record reflect 
that Minority Counsel has nodded his head up and down so as to indicate an affirmative 
response. 

CHAIRMAN
So ordered. 

GIBSON
Is this the only time since the President took the Oath of Office that he's collapsed? 

LEO
So far as I know. 

GIBSON
Is this the only time since the beginning of the campaign that he's collapsed? 

LEO
[long pause] No, it's not. 

GIBSON
I'd like to take you back to 30 October in St. Louis, Missouri. Jed Bartlet is the Democratic 
nominee for President and is about to participate in the third and final debate- 

JORDAN
Mr. Chairman, I would like to request a short recess. 

CHAIRMAN
We just got back from a recess. 

JORDAN
Sir, we have taken breaks at the request of nearly every member of this Committee while the 
witness has asked for a total of none. One time, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN
We'll take a five-minute break. Please, let's keep it to ten minutes. 

JORDAN
Come with me. 

GIBSON
Yeah, it will all come out. 

CLIFF
Excuse me. What's going on? 

CHAIRMAN
I was just asking the same thing. 

CLIFF
I don't know anything about testimony from October 30. 

GIBSON
It's okay, I got it. 

CLIFF
No, you don't got it. 

CHAIRMAN
We better go someplace and talk.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
The TV next to the desk shows people milling around and talking in the hearing room. 
Josh picks up the phone. He sighs as he waits for Leo to answer his cell phone.

LEO [VO] 
Yeah.

JOSH
Leo... I couldn't make it happen.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HALLWAY OUTSIDE WAITING ROOM - DAY
Leo is walking down to hall toward the waiting room.

LEO
Don't worry about it.

He hangs up his cell phone. A guard opens the door for him. Jordan is waiting. She closes 
the door. She's pretty upset but he just stares are her blankly.

JORDAN
[angry] You have to tell me what's going on now or I'm walking out the door.

LEO
[quietly] Look-

JORDAN
[sharply] Tell me now.

Leo turns and walks slowly along one side of the table.

LEO
On the day of the final debate, I was meeting with two potential donors...

FADE TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Leo is meeting with three men, two of whom are CEOs. CEO #1 is balding slightly; CEO #2 has a 
moustache. They're all chuckling. Before they sit down, Leo shakes each of their hands, a big 
smile plastered on his face.

LEO [VO]
It was nine days 'til the election. We were too close to call and I didn't wanna be the guy 
who ran outta money first.

CEO 1
You look nervous, Leo. [glances at CEO #2] Don't worry about it. I brought my wallet. 

CEO 2 chuckles.

LEO
Anybody wanna eat? I got steak sandwiches on the way.

CEO 2
Yeah and uh, let's have some drinks.

LEO
[pats CEO 2 on shoulder] Sure.

CUT TO INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT
Leo sits in a chair at one end of the table.

LEO
The President was at the debate site, walking the stage. [pauses, smiles wistfully] A podium 
is a holy place for him...

CUT TO: INT. DEBATE SITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Bartlet marches into the theater, followed closely by C.J., Sam, Toby, and Josh. They're all 
dressed casually. Bartlet is all business, focused. He assesses the space with his eyes as he 
walks toward the stage. C.J. smiles and shakes hands with a woman - probably one of the debate 
organizers. They all follow Bartlet up to the stage, where there are two podiums and a table 
for the moderators. Opposite the stage, there are hundreds of seats for the audience. Lots of 
aides are bustling about, making preparations.

LEO [VO]
He makes it his own like it's an extension of his body. You ever see a pitcher work the mound so 
the dirt does exactly what his feet want it to do? That's the President. He sees it as a genuine 
opportunity to change minds - also his best way of contributing to the team. He likes teams...

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

LEO
[smiles] ...I love him so much...

Jordan finally sits down at the table, facing Leo.

JORDAN
What was going on in your room?

LEO
[mumbling softly to himself] ...I like the little things...

JORDAN
I didn't hear you.

LEO
[jolted out of his inner thoughts, speaking louder] I said, "I like the little things." [smiles] 
The way a glass feels in your hand - a good glass, thick, with a heavy base. I love the sound an 
ice cube makes when you drop it from just the right height. 

The sound of an ice cube being dropped into a glass.

FADE TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Leo is staring, transfixed, as the CEOs pour themselves drinks. They're all sitting around 
a coffee table.

LEO [VO]
Too high and it'll chip when you drop it. Chip the ice and it'll melt too fast in the scotch.

CEO #2
You ever try this, Leo? It's Johnny Walker Blue. Bartenders are selling it for thirty bucks a shot. 

He uncorks the bottle and slowly pours the scotch into a glass on the table in front of him.

LEO [VO]
Good scotch sits in a charcoal barrel for 12 years. Very good scotch gets smoked for 29 years.

FADE TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

LEO
[nostalgic] Johnny Walker Blue...is 60-year-old scotch.

JORDAN
[impatiently] I don't care. What happened in the room, Leo?

LEO
I'm trying to tell you what happened.

FADE TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Cigar smoke fills the air. Leo and the donors are chuckling jovially, but Leo's face reveals the 
strain he's feeling as he watches the other men drink. His grin has taken on a dark quality. 
A lull in the laughter and conversation leaves Leo staring at the glass of scotch in CEO 1's hand. 
He looks around awkwardly for a moment, then tries to banish temptation by changing the subject.

LEO
Should we get to it?

The THIRD MAN is visible, sitting in the background off to one side, but his identity is hidden 
amidst the ample cigar smoke.

CEO 1
[holding up his glass] You don't wanna find out what a thirty dollar sip of scotch tastes like?

Leo stares at the glass. He's visibly struggling to control himself, so he responds with a smile 
and tries to sound relaxed and nonchalant.

LEO
[nods] Naw... I gotta... stay sharp for tonight.

CEO 1 sets his drink down and stands up.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

JORDAN
Why don't you just say, "I'm an alcoholic?"

LEO
They're two CEOs. I'm tryin' to get 'em to give me half-a-million dollars a piece right now. 
It's not really the best time to mention it. [pauses] The President's still at the debate site.

CUT TO: INT. DEBATE SITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Josh and Sam are huddled by one podium, talking. C.J. and Toby are conferring by the other 
podium. Dozens of aides are still bustling around in the background. Bartlet is standing by 
the moderators' table with the woman that C.J. greeted on the way into the theater.

WOMAN
How do you feel about the temperature, sir?

BARTLET
It's good.

WOMAN
It's not too cold?

BARTLET
[glancing around] It won't be later. This is a 550 seat theater and they'll be seated a 
half-hour before we start, so the temperature'll be up four to six degrees.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

JORDAN
[loudly, an edge to her voice] The hotel room, Leo.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
The four men are still seated around the coffee table - the two CEOs across from Leo, the 
third man still off to one side, sipping his drink. Dim light is filtering in through the 
windows and French doors. The bottle and glasses are on the table. Leo is hunched over in 
his seat, fidgeting.

CEO 2
We already gave to the RNC but we're worried we may have backed the wrong horse.

LEO
You wanna hedge your bet.

CEO 1
[nods] That's why we're here.

LEO
[nods, tense] Good... Now gimme a sip of that.

CEO 2 smiles and hands Leo his glass. The ice cubes rattle against the glass as Leo holds 
it and takes a quick sip. He tries to act like it's no big deal, but his expression 
indicates otherwise.

LEO
That's what I remember.

CEO 1 chuckles.

FADE TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

JORDAN
You had a drink.

LEO
I'm an alcoholic. I don't have one drink. [pauses] I don't understand people who have one 
drink. I don't understand people who leave half a glass of wine on the table. I don't 
understand people who say they've had enough. How can you have enough of feeling like this? 
How can you not want to feel like this longer? [pauses, sighs] My brain works differently.

JORDAN
Who was the third person in the room?

LEO
Well, now we've arrived at our problem.

FADE TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Leo is drinking scotch heartily and smoking as they talk.

LEO
[to CEOs] Count on it.

THIRD MAN
Whoa, you want to be careful there. 

Leo glances over at him as he stands up.

THIRD MAN
You're not the big money party. We are.

Leo chuckles silently and takes another sip of scotch.

CEO 1
[to Leo] Did I mention that he's thinking about running for Congress?

The third man sits down on the sofa next to Leo. It's Gibson. He smiles as Leo glances over 
at him again.

GIBSON
I'm thinking about it.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

JORDAN
You were drunk in front of Gibson?

LEO
I don't get drunk in front of people. I get drunk alone.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
The CEOs and Gibson have left. Leo opens the wall cupboard containing the mini-bar. He pulls 
out several miniature bottles of booze and checks his watch. He's stonefaced, almost like 
he's on auto-pilot.

LEO [VO] 
They were going over something at the debate site...

JORDAN [VO]
[impatiently] I don't want to hear about the debate site.

LEO [VO] 
The debate site is what happened. The debate site is how he gets to bring this up here.

CUT TO: INT. DEBATE SITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
On one side of the stage, Sam and Josh walk over to where C.J. and Toby have been talking. 
Bartlet is standing by himself on the other side of the stage. The theater is still buzzing 
with aides making preparations.

SAM
[to C.J.] Where's Leo?

JOSH
[to C.J. and Toby] I'd still like to go over the Social Security answer. We gotta get it 
down to 90 seconds.

C.J.
It's down to 90 seconds.

Bartlet wanders past a TV monitor on a cart. He's wearing a sweater over a dress shirt. 
He puts his glasses in his shirt pocket. He looks slightly distracted, perhaps a bit 
unsteady. He's looking down at the floor and holding onto his coat.

JOSH
It's not - and they're gonna cut him off.

The foursome slowly walk across the stage toward Bartlet, who's standing next to the TV 
monitor.

SAM
I put a stopwatch on him. When he just speeds up...

JOSH
When he speeds up, he speeds up. When he doesn't... It's 90 seconds. We need to cut some more.

Bartlet crosses his arms over his chest and hunches over slightly.

TOBY
[to Josh] Which words?

JOSH
Governor, what do you think? Governor?

Bartlet appears increasingly unsteady on his feet, a bit dazed, maybe short of breath. 
But it's subtle enough that his aides don't seem to notice.

JOSH
Sir, we were just saying on the Social Security answer...

BARTLET
[softly] No.

JOSH
...it's a tight ninety seconds, and...

BARTLET
[looking at floor, swaying] No, no. Not now.

JOSH
[scoffs, looks around at the others] Well, we gotta do it now, sir.

Bartlet stares blankly, straight ahead, then suddenly reaches out his right arm to balance 
himself, leaning on the TV for support.

TOBY
Something's wrong.

C.J.
Governor?

BARTLET
[gasping softly, trying to keep his balance] Yeah.

JOSH
Governor? [pause] Sir?

BARTLET
G'abbey...

SAM
You wanna sit down?

C.J.
Let me get some water. [turns around to grab a bottle of water]

BARTLET
G'abbey...

TOBY
He's saying, "Get Abbey."

JOSH
[to an aide] Get Abbey!

Bartlet loses his balance and pitches sideways toward Sam, who catches him, with assistance 
from Toby and Josh.

JOSH
Whoa...

Sam and Toby hold Bartlet up. A security agent rushes over to help.

TOBY
[looks up at C.J.] C.J.

C.J. stares at Toby. She looks shocked, a bit unsure about what to do.

JORDAN [VO]
He had an attack?

LEO [VO]
I mean, the doctor said it was an inner ear infection.

Toby and Sam help Bartlet regain his balance. They help him walk backstage, along with the 
agent. Josh walks behind them, stops, and takes out his cell phone. He looks up at C.J., 
concern all over his face.

LEO [VO]
But all Josh knew when he called me was that he'd collapsed. I was supposed to be down there 
already. I was supposed to be down there an hour ago.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK
Leo is sitting on the sofa, pouring himself another drink. The coffee table is covered with 
empty bottles and glasses. The phone by the bed rings and rings. His breathing is labored 
and he's unsteady on his feet as he struggles to stand up and make his way over to the bed. 
He takes a gulp of scotch, presses the speakerphone button, and sits down on the bed. 
Then he leans back on the pillows and closes his eyes, the glass still in his hand.

LEO
[loud] Yeah.

JOSH
[on phone] Leo, the Governor's sick.

The buzzer to Leo's suite sounds. He sits up slowly, awkwardly, as he registers what Josh 
is saying and that the buzzer is sounding.

LEO
Okay.

JOSH
[on phone] He collapsed. You gotta get down here.

The buzzer sounds again. Leo doesn't respond quickly to Josh; he tries not to panic, 
tries to get his bearing.

JOSH
[on phone] Leo.

LEO
Okay.

Leo sits up, lets go of his glass. Knocking on the door.

GIBSON
[at the door] It's Gibson.

LEO
[loud] Okay!

Suddenly, Leo processes the implications of Gibson being at his door. He rubs his forehead 
and sighs, exasperated and overwhelmed. He's breathing heavily again as he shakily stands up.

LEO
Okay... Okay... 

He walks to the door, smoothes his hair, and tries to straighten his rumpled suit. 
Then he opens the door.

LEO
Hey. 

Gibson walks right in. Leo stands by the open door, shifting uneasily.

GIBSON
I forgot my briefcase. 

Gibson grabs his briefcase from the floor by the sofa. In the process, he notices all the 
bottles and glasses on the coffee table. He turns to look at Leo, questioning.

GIBSON
You havin' a party?

LEO
[barely able to meet Gibson's gaze] I uh... I-I gotta get to the uh debate site. The Governor 
collapsed.

Gibson nods slightly, then leaves and closes the door behind him. Before Gibson is even out 
the door, Leo looks confused, then pained, then horrified and filled with regret as he 
realizes what he's done. He sighs and tries to catch his breath.

FADE TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT
Leo and Jordan are still sitting at the table, facing each other.

JORDAN [VO]
I don't understand how you could have a drink. I don't understand how, after everything you 
worked for, how on that day of all days you could be so stupid.

LEO
That's because you think it has something to do with smart and stupid. Do you have any idea 
how many alcoholics are in Mensa? You think it's a lack of willpower? That's like thinking 
somebody with anorexia nervosa has an overdeveloped sense of vanity. My father was an 
alcoholic. [leans forward] His father was an alcoholic. So, in my case...

JORDAN
[nods] Ain't nothin' but a family thing.

LEO
That's right.

JORDAN
Who knows?

LEO
Josh Lyman and the President.

JORDAN
Why nobody else?

LEO
Because.

JORDAN
That's a little boy's answer.

LEO
[pauses] I went to rehab. My friends embraced me when I got out. You relapse, it's not 
like that. "Get away from me" - that's what it's like.

There's a knock on the door and it opens. A security guard appears. Jordan turns to look 
at him.

GUARD
We're back in a minute.

JORDAN
Thank you.

The guard closes the door. Jordan turns back toward Leo.

JORDAN
Just out of curiosity... Why have you been asking me to have a meal with you every five 
minutes?

LEO
I like you. I've been tryin' to get it in under the wire.

Jordan takes a moment to take this in. She seems a bit surprised.

JORDAN
You'll answer the questions - simply and directly. I don't want to hear about Mensa. 
That'll be my job.

LEO
Okay.

Leo stands up, walks toward the door. Jordan doesn't move, a hint of a smile on her face. 
Leo opens the door as Jordan stands up and walks toward him.

JORDAN
Yes, by the way.

LEO
Yes? What?

JORDAN
Yes, I'd like to have dinner with you tonight.

LEO
[surprised] Okay.

Jordan walks out ahead of him and he follows her.

People are milling around, waiting for the hearing to reconvene. There's a small room off 
the hallway. A guard is standing beside the glass door. Inside the room, Bruno, Cliff, 
and Gibson are standing face to face arguing.

CLIFF
That's where you're going with this?

GIBSON
Yeah.

CLIFF
Just to embarrass the guy?

GIBSON
Just?

CLIFF
Leo McGarry's sobriety isn't the subject of these hearings. These hearings are to investigate...

CUT TO: INT. A SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLIFF
...if any rules - ethical or otherwise - were broken by Jed Bartlet while he was running 
for President.

GIBSON
That's nice, but I live in the actual world where the object of these hearings is to win.

CLIFF
[shakes his head] No... it's not.

Bruno listens closely, stonefaced.

GIBSON
It's the object of the Majority.

CLIFF
Not while I'm the Majority Counsel, it's not. This is bush league. This is why good people 
hate us. This right here. This thing. [Bruno turns his back on them and leans on a table.] 
This isn't what these hearings are about. [Gibson glances over at Bruno, peeved.] He cannot 
possibly have been properly prepared by counsel for these questions, nor should he ever 
have to answer them publicly.

Bruno turns back around, rubbing his chin, looking concerned.

CLIFF 
[jabbing his finger at Gibson] And if you proceed with this line of questioning, I will 
resign this committee and wait in the tall grass for you, Congressman, because you are 
killing the party.

Cliff glares at Gibson, who turns toward Bruno.

GIBSON
Who the hell is this?

Bruno meets his gaze.

CLIFF
[to Bruno] You don't have to make up your mind right now, Mr. Chairman...

GIBSON
Phil...

CLIFF
You don't have to make up your mind right now. Declare a recess 'til after the holidays. 
Buy yourself two weeks.

GIBSON
[to Cliff] And give him two weeks to circle the wagons?

Cliff maintains eye contact with Bruno, although he'd clearly love to respond to Gibson.

GIBSON
[to Bruno] How do you think the Speaker's gonna feel about this? To say nothing of the RNC?

BRUNO
[sighs] I need a minute.

Gibson quickly leaves, followed by Cliff, who practically slams the door on his way out. 
He walks through the crowd of people in the hallway, back toward the hearing room. 
Leo is in the hallway, shaking someone's hand, and notices Cliff walk by.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
A TV in the hallway is showing coverage of the hearing. Phones are ringing and staff members 
are bustling about. Sam walks through a swinging door and heads toward Josh's office.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Josh is leaning against the back of a chair, watching the hearing on his TV, and rubbing 
his forehead. Sam appears in the doorway.

SAM
I tried everybody.

JOSH
[looks up] It's all right.

SAM
I tried everybody. It was just a tough fit. And since I couldn't tell 'em what it was about...

JOSH
[points at the TV] They're back.

Sam sighs heavily. They both focus their attention on the TV.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY
Bruno gavels the hearing back into session.

BRUNO
Let's come to order.

Jordan and Leo are back in their seats. Jordan looks a little worried.

BRUNO
Mr. Gibson, you can proceed with your questioning.

Cliff sighs with exasperation. Leo stares at Gibson.

GIBSON
Mr. McGarry, 30 October in St. Louis, Missouri, the date Jed Bartlet was...

BRUNO
[holds up a hand in Gibson's direction] No, I'm sorry. [pause] Mr. McGarry, it's been a 
long day and, unless Counsel has an objection, I'm gonna resume this after the holidays.

Jordan and Leo are stunned.

LEO
What?

Cliff breathes a sigh of relief. Some members of the committee look pleasantly surprised, 
others not so much. Gibson shoots a warning glare at Bruno.

GIBSON
Mr. Chairman...

BRUNO
Mr. Calley.

CLIFF
Mr. McGarry, that concludes our questioning for today...

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY

CLIFF
[on TV] We'll pick it up here when the Chairman gavels these hearings back to order.

Josh sighs with relief.

CUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY
Leo is still confused and not sure if this is real.

LEO
I'm sorry...?

BRUNO
You're done for the day, sir. The House Reform and Government Oversight Committee stands 
in recess until January the 5th, and the Chair wishes everyone a Merry Christmas. 

The hum of conversation fills the room as people begin to stand up. Several people in the 
audience - journalists, presumably - leap out of their seats to go outside. Jordan is 
pleased, but very surprised. Leo still can't believe it. They steal short glances at each 
other. Jordan chuckles softly to herself.

LEO
What the hell...?

JORDAN
[shakes her head] I don't know. [They both stand up.] We have two weeks.

A woman who's been sitting behind Jordan hands her a coat. Leo leans against his chair.

LEO
I really had to tell you the damn story?

JORDAN
Shut up. I'm going to dinner with you.

She starts to leave, passing Margaret, who's standing behind Leo.

LEO
[softly] Yeah. [pauses, turns to look at her] Well, listen.

JORDAN
What?

LEO
You wanna do it tomorrow night instead?

JORDAN
What's tomorrow night?

LEO
It's Christmas Eve.

JORDAN
[pauses, smiles, nods] Okay.

LEO
[smiles] Okay.

Jordan walks off into the crowd. Leo gathers his things from the table and glances up at the 
committee dais. Cliff is standing behind his chair, also gathering his things. They meet each 
other's gaze for several long moments. Cliff looks away first, then quickly leaves. Leo seems 
to realize what - or who - may have stopped the hearing. Then he turns around toward Margaret, 
who's been chatting amiably with someone. Slowly, they walk out of the hearing room together.

FADE TO: EXT. WHITE HOUSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Later that evening, a guard opens one of the French doors for Leo. The door closes slowly 
behind him.

FADE TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS
Leo walks purposefully through the corridors, which are decorated with holiday lights. 
Everyone has gone for the day. Leo finally reaches his office, but he doesn't notice 
Bartlet - sitting in a corner chair, his feet propped up on another chair, patiently 
waiting for his friend. The office is dark; only a few lamps and a TV are still on.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo walks over to his desk to grab his phone messages, his back to Bartlet.

BARTLET
Well, well, well.

Leo turns around, only slightly surprised to see him.

BARTLET
Dodged a bullet.

LEO
For the moment.

BARTLET
[genially] Which is more than I can say for me in Rosslyn.

LEO
[nods, smiles] Yeah.

BARTLET
Did you get a date with her?

LEO
It's none of your business... [walks around behind his desk] I just came back to catch 
up on some work. [joking] See how badly you screwed up this church thing in Tennessee.

BARTLET
I did the church thing in Tennessee okay. I did it without you.

LEO
You mind if I make some calls - see if Tennessee's still one of the states and stuff?

Bartlet smiles, stands, and picks up a small package with a big red bow from the table 
beside him.

BARTLET
So anyway, I have a present for you.

Bartlet walks over to Leo's desk. Leo is surprised and acts like Bartlet really didn't 
have to get him anything - although he's clearly pleased. Bartlet hands him the gift.

BARTLET
Merry Christmas, Leo.

Leo removes the bow, revealing a small square black frame holding the "BARTLET FOR AMERICA" 
napkin from their first meeting in New Hampshire. It's wrinkled but it's still legible. 
Leo stares at it for several moments, then slowly looks up at Bartlet. Clearly, he's very 
moved.

BARTLET
That was awfully nice of you.

Leo looks down at the frame again and starts to lose control over his emotions. Bartlet 
senses this and leaves, walking through the passage to the Oval Office. Once Bartlet is 
gone, Leo shifts back and forth on his feet and holds the frame to his chest. When he 
can't stay standing any longer, he sits down heavily in his chair. And then he allows 
himself a good cry.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
