TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Military personnel are standing and sitting around the table. Leo enters.

LEO
Are we patched into the Pentagon? 

COLONEL CHASE 
Yeah. 

LEO 
We can hear them? 

COLONEL CHASE 
Yeah. 

LEO 
We can hear what they're saying at command? 

COLONEL CHASE 
Yeah. 

Leo looks around the room impatiently.

LEO
Why can't I hear anything? 

An officer holds up hand in a 'wait' gesture. 

LEO 
Guys, why aren't we hearing anything? 

MAN 
[on radio] 1.2 seconds to target launch... 

LEO 
Okay, why don't you just tell me to shut up? 

MAN 1 
[on radio] We have a target launch sequence. 

MAN 2 
[on radio] Go flight. 

MAN 1 
[on radio] Kwajalein Atoll, how do you read? 

MAN 3 
[on radio] We read you 5 by 5, command. Positive target launch sequence. 

LEO 
Here we go. 

MAN 1 
[on radio] Target launch in 5, 4, 3, 2... Target is aloft. 

MAN 2 
[on radio] We confirm target launch. 

LEO 
How long do we have? 

COLONEL CHASE 
Two minutes, ten seconds. 

LEO 
[looks at his watch] I'm going to see if I can get the President to watch this. [leaves] 

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
The President and the next Thailand Ambassador and his family are inside. 

BARTLET 
Mr. Sumatra, I understand you're a sports fan. 

SUMATRA 
Yes, sir, Mr. President. Golf. 

BARTLET 
Okay. Well, golf's not a sport. It's fine. Don't get me wrong but let's not you and 
I confuse it with things that men do. 

SUMATRA 
[smiling] Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
You know, we're going to Bangkok in June, I think. [to Charlie] June, Charlie? 

CHARLIE 
[checks his palm pilot] Yes, sir. 

SUMATRA 
You're staying at the Oriental? 

BARTLET 
Best hotel in the world, right?

SUMATRA 
Your own James Michener wrote many of his books at the Oriental and one of his 
typewriters remains in the suite they named for him. 

BARTLET 
Is that right? 

SUMATRA 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
[to Charlie] Make sure I see that. 

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir. 

BARTLET 
[to diplomatic aide] Tom? 

TOM 
Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I present his excellency, Tada Sumatra of 
Thailand and by request of the secretary of state ask that you accept his credentials 
from King Rhumibol Adulyadej as Thailand's ambassador to the United States. 

Bartlet accepts the papers from Sumatra.

BARTLET 
Mr. Sumatra, I accept your letter of credence from King Adulyadej and by affixing my 
signature and seal, [signs the paper] do hereby declare you to be an ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary. 

Sumatra bows and accepts the credentials back.

BARTLET
May our people know peace and prosperity. [They shake hands.] Congratulations. 

SUMATRA 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
We've got some gifts here and we're going to stand for pictures. 

TOM 
[directing Sumatra] Ambassador, right here. 

Sumatra's wife joins them for the photographs.

BARTLET 
[to Mrs. Sumatra] Madam, congratulations. 

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Charlie enters. 

CHARLIE
He's got another two minutes and then I've got to pull him. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Okay. 

LEO 
[enters] Hey, Charlie, is he done? 

CHARLIE 
He's got about another two minutes. 

LEO 
I'd like him in the situation room. Can I pull him? 

CHARLIE 
Should I tell him it's an emergency? 

LEO 
It's not an emergency, just time sensitive. 

CHARLIE 
Okay. [walks into the Oval Office] 

LEO 
[to Mrs. Landingham] What are you looking at? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
You're testing that preposterous contraption again. 

LEO 
It's not preposterous. It's not a contraption and mind your own business. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
In my day, we knew how to take care of ourselves. 

LEO 
Well, in your day, you could pretty much turn back the Indians with a Daniel Boone 
musket, couldn't you?

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Ah, sarcasm. The grumpy man's wit. 

LEO 
Sharpen a pencil, would ya? 

BARTLET 
[enters from Oval Office] What's up? 

LEO 
The target's in the air. They're going to launch the intercept any moment. 

BARTLET 
And I'm sure somebody will come along soon thereafter and tell it didn't work. 

LEO 
Why do you gotta take that attitude? 

BARTLET 
Cause it's not going to work. 

LEO 
What do I get if it works? 

BARTLET 
What do you get? 

LEO 
Yes. 

BARTLET 
Well, I can't make you Thailand's ambassador to the United States because I just signed 
that guy's letter. [points to Oval Office] 

LEO 
Come with me to the situation room.

Leo turns to leave. Bartlet looks skeptically at Mrs. Landingham, then follows Leo 
downstairs.

BARTLET
You know what you are? You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense. The Pentagon is Lucy. 

LEO 
I'm not familiar with the reference. 

BARTLET 
Peanuts. Charlie Brown. 

LEO 
I've heard of them. I'm just not conversant in them. 

BARTLET 
Why? 

LEO 
I've never read the comics. 

BARTLET 
Leo, were you born at the age of 55? 

LEO 
I know there's a dog. 

BARTLET 
Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it, except she'd pull it 
away at the last minute and Charlie Brown would fall on his butt.

LEO 
That's funny?

BARTLET 
No, but each time Lucy would find a way to convince Charlie Brown that this time she 
wouldn't pull the ball away. But she would and, once again, Charlie Brown would fall 
on his butt.

LEO
And that's funny?

BARTLET
Its' satirical.

LEO 
What's it satirizing? 

BARTLET 
The DOD bringing you to the Situation Room every time they run a new missile test so 
that you come tell me how great it works so I'll put money in the NMD system. 

LEO 
You should put money in the NMD system. 

BARTLET 
It doesn't work. 

LEO 
It will work. One day soon.

LEO 
There're a couple of three star generals in there. Call 'em Lucy and you're on your own. 

They enter THE SITUATION ROOM.

BARTLET 
Hey, where are we? 

GENERAL 1 
The kill vehicle is on a clear trajectory. 

LEO 
What's the time to the target. 

GENERAL 1 
Fifty seconds. Colonel, could you walk the President through? 

COLONEL CHASE 
Yes, sir. Mr. President, approximately three minutes ago, a missile was launched with a 
simulated nuclear warhead from the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. 

BARTLET 
And it's going to hit my garage in New Hampshire when?

COLONEL CHASE 
Well, sir, once the missile cleared cloud cover, it was detected by the early warning 
satellites, which launched an interceptor, or kill vehicle.

MAN 1
[on radio] 10 seconds to SRB separation.

OFFICER
SRB separation is solid rocket boosters separation. That means a high-resolution radar 
on the ground has gotten a lock on signal from the kill vehicle. 

MAN 1 
[on radio] Go SRB separation.

MAN 2 
[on radio] Confirm solid rocket booster separation.

MAN 1 
[on radio] Kill vehicle's away. Coming over at 044. 

MAN 3 
[on radio] 20 seconds to target intercept.

MAN 1 
[on radio] Go flight. 

BARTLET 
So what happens now? 

LEO 
In 20 seconds, it collides with the nuclear warhead. 

BARTLET 
Where? 

LEO 
Outer space.

COLONEL 
17 miles above the earth's atmosphere. 

BARTLET 
Okay, but we don't have anybody out there right now do we? 

LEO 
Sir...

BARTLET 
When we stay at the Oriental in Bangkok, we have to check out James Michener's typewriter.

MAN 1 
[on radio] Intercept in 5, 4... 

OFFICER 
Here we go. 

MAN 1 
[on radio] 3, 2, 1.

Silence. As everyone hangs their heads, an officer sighs. 

BARTLET 
Is that silence usually a pretty good sign? 

LEO 
No. 

MAN 1 
[on radio] Negative intercept. 

GENERAL 
Have we got sensor readings? 

COLONEL CHASE 
No.

MAN 1 
[on radio] Negative intercept. KM warhead has overshot it's target. 

BARTLET 
It was just enthusiastic. 

LEO 
By how much? 

GENERAL 
Uh, Leo... 

LEO 
[sternly] By how much did it miss the target?

GENERAL 
Colonel? 

COLONEL 
137. 

LEO 
We missed the target by 137 feet? 

COLONEL 
Miles. 

LEO 
[looks at him, incredulous] We missed it by 137 miles?! 

BARTLET 
When you consider the size of outer space, Leo, that's not so bad. 

COLONEL 
Sir? 

BARTLET 
By the way, the words you're looking for are "Oh good grief." [walks out]

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
An aerial view of outside of the White House.

CUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is on the podium. 

C.J.
For those of you who haven't seen it, it's a very lovely ceremony. It's relatively 
informal, the ambassadors are led into the Oval Office, probably with a few friends 
and family. They chat for a few moments with President, maybe exchange some gifts, 
and they're officially presented by the State Department's Chief of Protocol, who 
asks the President to accept the ambassador's credentials and the President signs 
a letter to that effect. [points to Katie] Yes? 

KATIE
C.J., you're accepting four new ambassadors this week. Is there an order or protocol 
in which they're seen? 

C.J.
There is! It's the order in which they arrived in Washington. This morning the President 
saw Ambassador Sumatra of Thailand, then will be Peter Hans of Sweden, followed by her 
Excellency Renee Ernesto of Argentina, Noah Jolla of Burkina Faso and the newly named 
British Ambassador to the United States will be arriving in the United States just as 
soon as he's been newly named. 

REPORTER 2
I thought it was gonna be... 

KATIE
Yeah. 

REPORTER 2
I forgot his name... 

C.J.
Anthony Brass. 

KATIE
Yeah. 

C.J.
Anthony Brass cited family obligations at home, and withdrew over the weekend. 

REPORTER 3
Yeah, but weren't they gonna replace him with... 

C.J.
Sir Christopher Nealingroach, yes. Sir Christopher has been diagnosed with a rare form 
of encephalitis, contracted during his recent posting to Kenya. 

REPORTER 1
So who's the new British ambassador? 

C.J.
I don't know. As soon as the State Department tells me, I'll know. In the meantime, it's 
pool photographs only until tomorrow night when there'll be a cocktail reception for the 
new ambassadors. That's all. [Reporters get up and leave] Does anybody wanna know who's 
been here the longest? The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps...anybody? Guys, you know I 
study these things just for you! It's Prince Vandaar Ben Sultan of Saudi Arabia. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is talking to Carol.

C.J.
I could have also told them that Burkina Faso has a population of eleven million and 
in even years they host Africa's largest crops market. 

CAROL:
Yes. 

C.J.
I need a chance to use that knowledge. 

SAM 
[comes up from behind] C.J.! 

C.J. passes paper to Carol, who leaves. Sam walks with C.J.

C.J.
You know the chief crops of Burkina Faso? 

SAM
No. 

C.J.
Millet, sorghum, rice, peanuts and cotton. 

SAM
[beat] You should mention in your afternoon briefing that we've accepted a last minute 
invitation for the President to address the Global Defense Council tomorrow night at 
the Sheraton. 

C.J.
I thought we passed on the GDC. 

SAM
Well we passed on it three months ago when we thought the President was going to be in 
South America. But the trip got canceled and they lost their keynote speaker, so we're 
gonna use this to launch CARE, and that's what I want you to announce at the afternoon 
briefing. 

C.J.
CARE? 

SAM
Yeah. 

C.J.
Okay... 

SAM
Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. 

C.J.
Yeah. 

SAM
You don't know what it is. 

C.J.
The Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. It's an effort by which we clean the air and 
rehabilitate it. 

SAM 
Okay, how could you... 

C.J.
I'm not involved in the nuances of environmental policy! 

SAM
Which will come as a relief to environmentalists. 

C.J.
Sam! 

SAM
I'll brief you later. 

C.J.
I knew the crops of Burkina Faso! 

SAM 
I'll brief you later. 

Sam leaves C.J. and walks into THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Bonnie, Ginger, and several other 
people are seated around the table with notepads and laptops.

SAM
Have we heard from Toby?

BONNIE
No. 

SAM
Do we know if he's landed? 

BONNIE
No. 

SAM
How is everyone doing in here? 

BONNIE
They're doing fine. 

SAM
Is global warming a real environmental condition, or merely a temporary anomaly? Is it 
a global threat, or the exaggerated claim of alarmists? The time for such debate is over. 
As of today, it shall be the unequivocal position of the United States government that 
global warming constitutes a clear and present danger to the health and future well-being 
of this planet and all its inhabitants. Did somebody get that? 

GINGER
Yes. 

SAM
I didn't see anyone writing. 

BONNIE
We already wrote it. 

SAM
I just added a thing! 

GINGER
We got it. 

SAM
I just added "the time for such debate is over." 

GINGER
We got it! 

SAM
It sets up the whole reveal. 

GINGER
Yes. 

SAM
Okay. 22 trillion in benefits versus one half a trillion in compliance costs we're 
making sure that's right? 

BONNIE
Yes. 

SAM
We're making sure in a couple places? 

BONNIE
They're making sure. 

SAM
I wanna cite three different sources. 

BONNIE
Fine. 

SAM
And we don't know if Toby's back? 

BONNIE
Sam! You'll know as soon as he's back!

Toby walks in in a coat and carrying luggage. 

GINGER 
[holding a cell phone] Sam... 

SAM
Is it Toby? 

GINGER:
Yeah... 

SAM
Can I have the phone? 

GINGER 
[points] He's standing right there.

Sam turns and sees Toby in the HALLWAY.

SAM 
Thanks. 22,000 fewer respiratory related hospital admissions? I don't wanna use the 
stats unless I have three sources. [walks over to Toby] How was your trip? 

TOBY
It was fine. [clears throat] What's goin' on? 

SAM
The President's gonna speak at the GDC conference tomorrow night. 

TOBY
I'm sorry? 

SAM
He's gonna launch the... 

TOBY
What are you talking about? 

SAM
He's gonna launch CARE. 

TOBY
Since when? 

SAM
Their keynote speaker fell through. 

TOBY
When was this decision made? 

SAM
Last night. 

TOBY
Why wasn't I involved? 

SAM
You were in Kansas City. 

TOBY
I have a telephone. 

SAM
Toby! 

TOBY
I have a damn telephone, Sam! 

SAM
Frankly, I didn't think... I thought there'd be a consensus. 

TOBY
Who was at this meeting?

SAM
Where?

TOBY
Where the decision was made.

SAM
It was me, Carl Todd of the EPA, James Siskin was there... Toby we've been looking for 
an opportunity to launch... 

TOBY
Leo wasn't there? 

SAM
No... been looking for a platform for this, the opportunity... 

TOBY
Let me understand... 

SAM
...presented itself. What's the problem?

They go into TOBY'S OFFICE.

TOBY
There are a number of problems, anyone of which I could have told you about, had you 
gotten me on the phone! Well, one thing, we already blew off the AFL CIO, cause we told 
them the President was gonna be in South America. 

SAM
The President was gonna be in South America, now he's not. 

TOBY
Instead, he's speaking for labor's good friend, the environmental lobby! 

SAM
No... 

TOBY
Also, he's the President of the United States, he's nobody's understudy! You've got 
him goin' out there like... Joey Bishop! 

SAM
I gotta say, I hear all that, but the President, he's very enthusiastic. 

TOBY
Of course he's enthusiastic. 

SAM
I'm sayin', I wasn't in there twisting his arm! I told him this opportunity had opened 
up, that we had enough notes so that I could finish the speech in time. He asked us a 
few questions, we answered them and he said yes! 

TOBY
Alright... I don't... alright. 

SAM
It's gonna be a good speech! 

TOBY
Yeah.

GINGER
[enters] They need you. 

SAM
Thanks. [leaves] 

GINGER
How was the trip? 

TOBY
Fine. I need to see Leo. 

GINGER
Yeah. 

Ginger leaves as Toby picks up the phone.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is standing against the wall by the door, while talking to C.J. on the speaker phone. 

C.J.
It's not gonna be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 

JOSH 
[sounding strained] I heard! 

C.J.
I said it's not gonna be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 

JOSH
And I said I heard! 

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
But I like to say Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 

JOSH
Who's it gonna be? 

C.J.
I'm waiting to hear from someone at the State Department. 

JOSH
Me too. 

C.J.
Maybe it'll be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Can I stop talking to you now? 

C.J.
What are you doing? 

JOSH
I'm standing with my back straight against the wall. 

C.J.
Why? 

JOSH
I was told by the doctors it would relax me. 

The door opens. Donna enters and hits Josh with the door.

DONNA
Josh... [turns and sees him behind the door] 

C.J.
Gotta go! [hangs up] 

JOSH
Yeah. 

DONNA
Are you okay? 

JOSH
Yeah. What?

DONNA
Is it true that Leo can't stand a guy named Lord John Marbury? 

JOSH
Why? 

DONNA
A reporter asked me. 

JOSH
What's a reporter doing talking to you? 

DONNA
He's a friend of a friend. 

JOSH
Leo McGarry has nothing but respect and affection for John Marbury. 

DONNA
That's what I said. 

JOSH
Good, 'cause Leo thinks he's a lunatic. 

DONNA
He's very handsome. 

JOSH
That may be so, but Leo thinks he's a lunatic. 

DONNA
Are you threatened by his brilliance? 

JOSH
No. 

DONNA
You seem threatened by his brilliance. 

JOSH
How do you know he's brilliant? 

DONNA
I saw his picture. 

JOSH
I'm not threatened by his brilliance, nor am I threatened by his good looks. 

DONNA
What about his charm? 

JOSH
I'm not threatened at all... 

DONNA
I'm sorry, I meant Leo. 

JOSH
Neither Leo or I are threatened by his brains, his looks or his charm. He is, however, 
a lunatic Brit and we're grateful there's an ocean between us. 

DONNA
There isn't anymore. 

JOSH
There isn't what? 

DONNA
An ocean between you. 

JOSH
Please, don't tell me... 

DONNA
He's the new British ambassador to the United States. 

JOSH 
[sounding strained again] Yeah... [gets up] 

DONNA
He's dreamy. [walks over to the door] 

JOSH
I'm just gonna, you know, stand next to the wall for a while longer. 

DONNA
Okay. 

She throws the door open, which slams into the wall very close to him, and leaves. 
Josh groans.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is sitting at his desk while Toby knocks on the door and enters. 

TOBY 
Josh. 

JOSH 
Okay, what I need people to do is knock. 

TOBY 
I did knock. 

JOSH 
But you didn't wait for a response. 

TOBY 
Why would I? 

JOSH 
'Cause, I could have been relaxing by standing behind that door. 

TOBY 
[beat] All right. 

JOSH 
How was your trip? 

They walk out of the office and head through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

TOBY 
It was fine. So we're pinch hitting at the GDC conference. 

JOSH 
For the record, I didn't think it was a good idea and I said so. 

TOBY 
And it seems to have helped. Look, we can't appear to be at the beckon call of the 
environment! 

JOSH 
We could try insulting them. 

TOBY 
Yes. 

JOSH 
I'm kidding. 

TOBY 
I'm not! 

JOSH
We were invited.

TOBY
Don't care.

JOSH 
What do you have? 

TOBY 
Environmental terrorists burned down a ski resort, and the GDC didn't comment. 

JOSH 
Why did environmental terrorists burn down a ski resort? 

TOBY 
To save the lynx. 

JOSH 
The links? 

TOBY 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
Environmental terrorists burned down a ski resort to save a golf course? 

TOBY 
It's an animal. 

JOSH 
Sam's going to have strong objections. 

TOBY 
Yes, I know. 

JOSH 
All right, you want me to talk to Leo? 

TOBY 
I'm going to talk to him. I want you to talk to C.J.. 

JOSH 
About what? 

TOBY 
The Will Roger's dinner is going to ask Cornelius Sykes to host. 

JOSH 
[stops and faces Toby] You're kidding me! 

TOBY 
Nope. 

JOSH 
He didn't laugh at the joke. 

TOBY 
Talk to C.J. 

JOSH 
Yeah. [turns away to leave] 

TOBY 
Why do you relax by standing behind the door? 

JOSH
[comes back] I'm not standing behind the door, I'm standing with my back straight 
against the wall, so that if... 

TOBY 
I don't care. [leaves abruptly] 

JOSH 
'kay. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is talking on the phone, while Toby enters. 

LEO 
Keith. Keith, I can't tell him that. I can't tell the President that nine out of ten 
things went right, he's going to say, "Yeah, but we didn't hit anything!" Would you 
please? Thank you. [hangs up the phone, to Toby] We had an NMD test this morning. 
We were successful in nine out of ten criteria. 

TOBY 
We missed. 

LEO 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
By how much? 

LEO 
We were trying to shoot down an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile; once you 
miss, it really doesn't matter by how much. 

TOBY 
I suppose. 

LEO 
A hundred and thirty-seven miles. 

TOBY 
[rolls his eyes] Sam just told me about his speech. 

LEO 
Which speech? 

TOBY 
The GDC. 

LEO 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Leo. 

LEO 
[defensively] I wasn't in the meeting. 

TOBY 
How did that... 

LEO 
I wasn't in the meeting! It happened fast. 

TOBY 
I'm saying how'd it... 

LEO 
It happened fast. Sam pitched it, and the President wanted to do it. 

TOBY 
Leo, how could you not be in that meeting? 

LEO 
'Cause I'm trying to get the President to warm up to a missile shield that's supposed 
to save humanity and there's a limit to the number of rooms I can be in at once! You 
want to file a complaint? 

TOBY 
No. 

LEO 
Good. 

TOBY 
Here's what I think... 

LEO 
Screw the environmental lobby? 

TOBY 
[angry] Did I say that? Did I say, 'screw the environmental lobby?' 

LEO 
You didn't say anything. 

TOBY 
That's right, and before I even open my mouth, you decide I'm going to say 'screw the 
environmental lobby?' 

LEO 
I apologize. 

TOBY 
There's an extent to which we've gotta screw the environmental lobby. 

LEO 
Yep. 

TOBY 
A clear and public demonstration that the President's not beholden to them isn't a bad 
idea right now. 

LEO 
You think he should walk into their ballroom and smack them around? 

TOBY 
I really do, for 30 seconds out of a 40 minute address announcing the initiative 
they love. 

LEO 
How do you think they're gonna feel about the 30 seconds? 

TOBY 
Not that good, but that's the point. We don't have to move to our right if there's an 
opportunity to spank the people to our left. 

LEO 
Anything in particular we want to spank them for? 

TOBY 
Failing to publicly admonish acts of eco-terrorism. 

LEO 
The GDC doesn't engage in acts of eco-terrorism. 

TOBY 
Yes, but they fail to publicly admonish those who do. 

LEO 
For example? 

TOBY 
A 12 million dollar Colorado ski development that was under construction was set on 
fire because it threatened the habitat of a rare local lynx. 

LEO 
Is a lynx a...? 

TOBY 
I don't know. I... I think... I think it's like a possum or something, and it doesn't 
matter... 

LEO 
All right, tell Sam to find a place to out it. 

TOBY 
I don't want it in the advanced text. I don't want Sam and his fourteen objections. 
It should just be a drop-in. 

LEO 
I'll talk to the President. Anything else? 

TOBY 
137 miles. 

LEO 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Is that a lot? 

LEO 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Okay. [leaves] 

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY
C.J. is sitting in the first row, a few reporters with notes behind her, Sam is 
perched on the windowsill. They are going over his speech. 

SAM 
We have 30 minutes at the ballroom after the speech to spin and obviously, the next 
morning as well. Among the things you want to be emphasizing are what? 

REPORTER 1
[chewing a sandwich] America is the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. 

SAM 
We have 4% of the population. We are responsible for 25% of the Greenhouse emission. 
[stands] How are we going to reduce those levels of Greenhouse emissions, you ask? 

C.J. 
Through the Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. 

SAM 
Yes, which you can read about in bullet points, beginning on page 11. Please don't skip 
the footnotes, and please, don't just read what's underlined. 

The reporters sigh. Sam munches on a baby carrot. 

C.J. 
Question. 

SAM 
[chewing] Yes. 

C.J. 
Were you able to get girls to go out with you in High School? 

SAM 
Yes. 

C.J. 
Really? 

SAM 
[returns to the windowsill] Under these regulations there will be a cap on the volume 
of carbon dioxide a company could emit in a year, but what's the good news? 

REPORTER 2 
If the company comes in lower than the cap, they could sell the balance of their 
emissions allowance to another company. 

SAM 
Creating what? 

REPORTERS 1 & 2 
A cash incentive! 

SAM 
A cash incentive. Can you tell us anything else about that, C.J.? 

C.J. 
No, but I can tell you that lumber, cocoa beans, aluminum and petroleum products are 
the major exports of Cameroon. 

Sam stares at her. Josh opens the door and peeks in. 

SAM 
[shocked by C.J.'s lack of caring] Then we're all set. 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
Can I have her for a second? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

C.J. 
[to Josh] Why do you ask him and not me? 

JOSH 
He looked in charge! 

C.J. 
Of where I go? 

JOSH 
Can we... please? C.J. and Josh walk outside and close the door. 

C.J. 
Did you hear they named John Marbury British Ambassador? 

JOSH 
Yes, I did. 

C.J. 
Lord John Marbury? 

JOSH 
I know, it's got to be like Davy Jones himself is showing up. 

C.J. 
Okay, don't make fun of Davy Jones, all right? He once wrote me a letter. He took that 
kind of time. And he still tours! Plus, my love for John Marbury is real, it's not a 
schoolgirl crush. He calls me [gently] 'Princepessa.' 

JOSH 
Does he? 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

JOSH 
Well, he calls Leo 'Gerald.' 

C.J. 
He's eccentric. 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

C.J. 
What do you need? 

JOSH 
Janice Barry is saying they're going to ask Cornelius Sykes to host the Will Rogers' 
dinner. 

C.J. 
They know for sure? 

JOSH 
They're going to ask him on Monday. 

C.J. 
They're going to stir this up again. 

JOSH 
Yeah. 

C.J. 
He didn't laugh at the joke! How many more ways are there for me to say that? He didn't 
laugh at the joke! 

JOSH 
You guys are friends. I was thinking... 

C.J. 
We're not friends. 

JOSH 
You know each other. 

C.J. 
I don't hang out with Corey Sykes! 

JOSH 
Yeah, but you know him! 

C.J. 
[beat] Where is he? 

JOSH 
He's in New York, doing standup. I thought since you were going to be there, you... 

C.J. 
I'll see him tomorrow night. 

JOSH 
Thank you. [turns to leave] 

C.J. 
He didn't laugh at the joke! 

JOSH 
[turns to her while walking away] You'll see him tomorrow night? 

C.J. 
Yes. 

Donna catches up with Josh. 

DONNA 
Josh! 

JOSH 
[walking backwards] Could you see that a meeting is arranged for tomorrow night in 
New York with C.J., Cornelius Sykes, and no one else? 

DONNA 
Yeah. 

C.J., standing in front of the closed door of the Press Room, yells.

C.J. 
Thank you! 

Donna and Josh are walking through the HALLWAYS. 

DONNA 
I was thinking... 

JOSH 
Yeah? 

DONNA 
When Marbury gets here... 

JOSH 
Yeah? 

DONNA 
You can encourage him to introduce me to any royal and single men he might know. 

JOSH 
That's a good idea, I'm gonna do that. 

DONNA 
You're not really though, are you? 

JOSH 
No. 

Donna makes a pouting face, and they part.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is accepting papers from the newly named ambassador of Sweden. The ambassador's 
wife and two children are in the room, so is the Presenter and a few men with cameras. 

BARTLET 
I think a lot of people don't realize that Swedes have lived in Sweden more than 5,000 
years longer than nearly any other European people. 

AMBASSADOR
That's right, sir. 

BARTLET 
In fact, Gothic tribes from Sweden played a major role in the disintegration of the 
Roman Empire, did they not? 

AMBASSADOR
They did. 

BARTLET 
So you've got that to answer for! 

AMBASSADOR 
[smiling] Yes, sir! 

Bartlet laughs. Leo enters the office.

TOM
Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I present his Excellency Peter Hans of Sweden, 
and by request of the Secretary of State ask that you accept his credentials from King 
Karl Gustav as Sweden's ambassador to the United States. 

BARTLET 
[puts his eyeglasses on] Mr. Hans, I accept your letter of credence from King Gustav, 
and, by affixing my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be an Ambassador 
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. [returns the papers] 

AMBASSADOR
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
Congratulations. 

They shake hands. 

TOM
Mr. Ambassador. [shows Hans to a spot next to Bartlet] Family, please. 

They pose for pictures. Leo shakes hands with Hans.

LEO
Congratulations, Ambassador. 

AMBASSADOR
Leo. 

LEO 
Is he still holding you responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire? 

AMBASSADOR
Oh, yes. 

LEO 
Welcome to my world. I'll see you at the reception, right? 

AMBASSADOR
Yes, sir. 

LEO 
Congratulations. 

TOM
This way. 

The ambassador leaves with his family, everyone else exits.

BARTLET 
Sweden has a 100% literacy rate, Leo, a hundred percent! How do they do that? 

LEO 
Well, maybe, they don't and they also can't count. 

BARTLET 
Maybe. 

LEO 
[hands him some papers] Sir, I really think you should know... 

BARTLET 
Yes? 

LEO 
That nine out of ten criteria that the DOD lays down for success in these tests were met. 

BARTLET 
The tenth being? 

LEO 
They missed the target. 

BARTLET 
[with sarcasm] Damn! 

LEO 
Sir! 

BARTLET 
So close. 

LEO
Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
That tenth one! See, if there were just nine... 

LEO 
Look, the tracking software on the KM vehicle clearly acquired a read on both the 
target and the decoy. 

Charlie walks in and gives Bartlet a blue folder.

LEO
And, for the first time ever, successfully rendered a clean identification differential. 

BARTLET 
Leo, seriously, when they were telling you that on the phone, how stupid did you think 
you'd sound saying that to me? 

LEO 
This project needs money! 

BARTLET 
It doesn't work. 

LEO 
Neither did several phases of Apollo 11, but Neil Armstrong claims it was a success. 

BARTLET 
Do we need to decide this right now? 

LEO 
No. 

BARTLET 
Okay. 

LEO 
So, about the GDC speech... 

BARTLET 
[putting his glasses on and reading] Yeah? 

LEO 
Since we're giving them exactly what they want, Toby thinks it's not such a bad idea 
if we signal our independence as well. 

BARTLET 
How? 

LEO 
A drop-in. Eco-terrorism that's gone unadmonished by the GDC. 

BARTLET 
For example? 

LEO 
A ski development in Colorado that threatened a rare lynx was burned in protest. 

BARTLET 
And we can't take it for granted that everyone pretty much fundamentally opposes arson? 

LEO 
A year and a half ago you stood in the Mural Room and took Al Caldwell's head off because 
the Christian League hadn't publicly admonished religious extremists. 

BARTLET 
It would be hypocrisy not to hold our friends to the same standard... 

LEO 
Yes. 

BARTLET 
Yet it feels strange to score political points by doing the right thing. 

LEO 
Yeah. 

BARTLET 
[gruffly] I'm victim to my own purity of character.

LEO 
Whatever. [beat] We'll get you some information on the lynx, which is a kind of a possum, 
I think. 

BARTLET 
Okay, well, it's not a kind of a possum, so why don't you get me that information. 
Toby doesn't want it in the speech? 

LEO 
Just the drop-in. 

BARTLET 
Did you hear? 

LEO 
About Marbury? 

BARTLET 
Ain't it great? 

LEO
Yes, sir. And I assume you're enjoying my suffering? 

BARTLET 
Absolutely. 

LEO 
Anything else? 

BARTLET 
No. 

LEO 
Thank you, Mr. President. [walks out]

BARTLET
[shouts after him] 2,000 environmentalists are going to try to kill me tomorrow night! 

Charlie enters again. 

CHARLIE 
We should go, sir. 

BARTLET 
They're going to come at me with vegan food and pitchforks! 

CHARLIE 
[while they walk out] That doesn't really sound like something people do. 

BARTLET 
Still, I'd like you to get between me and any boiled seaweed you see coming my way. 

CHARLIE 
Yep. 

Toby is waiting outside and walks with the President. Charlie is walking behind them. 

TOBY 
Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
Leo just talked to me. 

TOBY 
About the GDC tonight. 

BARTLET 
Yeah, I'm not doing this for the politics, I'm doing it because it's the right thing 
to do. 

TOBY 
Well, I'm doing it for the politics. 

BARTLET 
A lynx isn't a possum. 

TOBY 
I think it's in the possum family. 

BARTLET 
It's a cat. 

TOBY 
Oh, and we don't have enough of those.

Bartlet smiles.

BARTLET 
How did Sam feel about this? [beat] Toby? 

TOBY 
This isn't government camp, it's not like... it's not important that everybody gets to 
play! 

They stop and face each other.

BARTLET 
I'm not going to tell you how to run your office, Toby. 

TOBY 
Thank you, sir. 

BARTLET 
[beat, resumes walking] Vegan food. Coming at me all night long. 

As they leave, Toby spots C.J. who is wearing her coat and has a briefcase. 

TOBY 
C.J.? 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Where are you going? 

C.J. 
New York, New York, Toby. The town so nice they named it twice. 

TOBY 
What are you doing there? 

C.J. 
I'm receiving the Matrix Award from New York women in communications. 

TOBY 
For what? 

C.J. 
I discovered a comet. What do you mean, 'for what?' 

TOBY
Look...

C.J.
Past winners, by the way, include Cokie Roberts, Diane Sawyer and Ms. Leslie Stahl. 

TOBY 
Josh talked to you about... 

C.J. 
Yeah, I'm meeting him for a drink after the thing. 

TOBY 
You briefed on the Clean Air Rehabilitation...? 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
Okay, you might need this: [reads from his pocketbook] 'The President has always spoken 
out against moderate groups not taking responsibility for extremism, and he isn't going 
to stop with the environmental lobby. Friends are honest with each other.' [hands C.J. 
the piece of paper he read from] 

C.J. 
He's gonna do a drop-in? 

TOBY 
Yeah. 

C.J. 
I'll see you tomorrow night. [leaves]

Bonnie opens the door next to which Toby is standing. 

BONNIE
Hey, Toby, you want to see the speech? Sam's writing a good one. 

She gives him the copy of the speech. Toby looks over it.

TOBY
Yeah. 

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

SAM 
[fixing his tie] Climate changes have accelerated. Glaciers are shrinking. 
Polar sea ice is... what? 

TOBY 
[from communications office] It's thinning. 

SAM 
The polar sea ice is thinning causing a rise in sea levels round the globe. 

TOBY 
And what do we say when they say, "But changes in the Clean Air Rehabilitation effort 
seriously choke the auto, trucking and utility business"? 

SAM 
[walks to Toby] 22 trillion dollars in benefits produced versus a half a trillion in 
compliance costs. [keeps walking past Toby] 

TOBY 
Public health benefits? 

SAM 
We'll make that clear. [turns back to face Toby] Where's C.J.? 

TOBY 
She's in New York. 

SAM 
What's she doing in New York? 

TOBY 
She had a lunch - media women... women of media? 

SAM 
That was this afternoon. 

TOBY 
She had to stay around. 

SAM 
So it's just me? 

TOBY 
Yeah. Call me from the place. 

SAM 
Yeah. 

He walks out of bullpen and into THE ROOSEVELT ROOM and picks up a copy of the speech.

SAM
Final draft?

GINGER 
Well, it's the 12th draft. Whether or not it's the final draft is up to you. 

SAM 
Was that sass? 

GINGER 
Yeah. 

SAM 
Okay. The difference between a good speech and a great speech is the energy with which 
the audience comes to their feet at the end. Is it polite? Is it a chore? Are they 
standing up because their boss just stood up? No, we want it to come from their socks. 
We've got a half an hour. Let's read this again. 

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo and Josh are inside. 

LEO 
Every time one of these tests fails, congressional Democrats jump on it as a reason to 
kill the program. 

JOSH 
You're not going to turn the President around on the missile shield. 

LEO 
Well, I'm not going to turn him around today. And probably not tomorrow. But as long as 
somebody has the money to keep trying to make it work, then I'm fine. 

MARGARET
[walks in] Leo? 

LEO 
Yeah? 

MARGARET
There's someone here to see you. 

LEO 
Who? 

MARBURY [VO] 
Gerald? 

LEO 
Oh, God. 

MARBURY 
[enters] Gerald! Old friend! 

LEO 
Good to see you, ambassador. 

They shake hands. Margaret leaves.

MARBURY 
It's as if the gods themselves insist that we be not long apart, you and I. 

LEO 
They do seem to strongly insist upon that, yes. 

MARBURY 
Your assistant, Margaret, is looking positively buxom. 

LEO 
Thank you, I'll tell her. 

MARGARET [VO] 
Thank you. 

MARBURY 
[turns in her direction] Oh yes, well done! 

LEO
John?

MARBURY
[indicates a woman behind him] Oh, my aide, Caprice. 

CAPRICE 
[shakes Leo's hand] How do you do? 

LEO 
Leo McGarry. 

JOSH 
Good to see you, ambassador. 

MARBURY 
God bless you, Josh. The prayers of millions were answered. 

JOSH 
[a little stunned] Thank you, sir. 

MARBURY 
I have come. 

LEO 
Yes. 

MARBURY 
I am Lord John Marbury, along with my aide, Caprice, and I am hereby presenting my 
credentials in the fervent hope... 

LEO 
John, we do that later with the President. 

MARBURY 
Excellent! [hands papers back to Caprice] 

LEO 
I will tell you, though, that I personally welcome you and I look forward to our new 
partnership. 

MARBURY 
As do I. 

LEO 
I know we've had our differences in the past but I think you know I respect you. 
I congratulate you on this auspicious occasion. As a matter of fact, the timing 
of your arrival couldn't be better. 

MARBURY 
How so? 

JOSH 
Leo's trying to convince the President to give the NMD more time. 

LEO 
And you're an expert in the field. And I hope I can count on your support. 

MARBURY 
You may hope for it but you'll not have it. 

LEO 
Why not? 

MARBURY 
Because the NMD is an absurdly wasteful military boondoggle that will never produce 
a working missile. It violates any number of elements of the ABM treaty. And any 
argument you make in its defense will surely be moronic. 

JOSH 
Ah, detente. 

MARBURY 
I'm sorry, Gerald. 

LEO 
We're going to have this out. 

MARBURY 
Excellent. 

LEO 
Let's go get you knighted or whatever the hell it is we do.

COREY SYKES 
Hey. 

C.J. 
Hey, how you doing? 

COREY 
Not bad. 

C.J. 
Thanks for taking the time. 

COREY 
Yeah, I've gotta get back pretty soon. 

C.J. 
I won't take long.

They sit.

COREY 
You wanna stay for the show? 

C.J. 
I gotta get the 7:00 shuttle. 

COREY 
You want something to drink? 

C.J. 
Uh, a club soda. 

COREY 
[to waitress] Alicia? Can I get some club soda? 

C.J. 
Oh, I haven't seen the movie yet. 

COREY 
You should see it. It's good. 

C.J. 
That's what everyone's saying. 

COREY 
Well, I appreciate that. 

C.J. 
[laughs] So, you know, this is about the Will Rogers dinner. 

COREY 
Yeah. 

C.J. 
They're going to ask you to host and obviously the President's going to be there. 
[beat] We appreciate the support. 

COREY 
You want me to say no. 

C.J. 
We think the press'll go back two years and bring up the whole...

COREY 
Let 'em. 

C.J. 
I don't want to. Uh, you know how I feel about you. You know I don't mean you disrespect. 

COREY 
You don't? 

C.J. 
No! 

COREY 
I've raised money for you. I've registered voters for you. I've done commercials for you. 
And I voted for you. Because of something I never did wrong two years ago, you don't want 
to be on the same dais with me? 

C.J. 
That's not...

COREY 
It takes a special kind of arrogance not to think that that's not disrespectful. 

The waitress puts their drinks on the table.

COREY
Thanks, Alicia. [to C.J.] Make your case. I've got to be funny in a while.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY

LEO 
Yes. 

MARBURY 
It could have missed by 37 fewer miles and it still would have missed by 100 miles. 
It doesn't work. 

LEO 
That depends what your definition is. 

MARBURY 
My definition is precisely the same as everyone else's. 

BARTLET 
[walks in with Josh and Charlie] John! 

MARBURY 
Mr. President. 

BARTLET 
[shakes his hand] It's good to have you here. 

MARBURY 
Your servant, as always. 

BARTLET 
What made you agree to take the post? 

MARBURY 
Oh, I don't know. I suppose it was possible I was drunk. 

JOSH 
Reasonable bet.

BARTLET 
Listen, I gotta go a few blocks across town to give an address on global warming and the 
future of our planet. That's not something you're interested in, right? 

MARBURY 
Good God, no. 

BARTLET 
Okay. Well, stay here and fight with Leo about something. We'll get you some dinner. 
I'll be back in an hour. We'll do your thing and then enjoy your reception.

Indeed.

C.J. 
Corey... 

COREY 
Hang on. 

C.J. 
No, wait a second... 

COREY 
Let me finish. 

C.J. 
It was not a benign joke. 

COREY 
C.J.... 

C.J. 
You don't tell benign jokes. 

COREY 
It's a matter of... 

C.J. 
It was a joke about New York City cops shooting black men.

COREY 
I'm a black man. I'm in a room full of rich Democrats in an election year. What you 
thought I was going to talk about airline food? 

C.J. 
It was a political fundraiser in the heat of a national campaign. You weren't doing a 
2 a.m. set at Catch a Rising Star. 

COREY 
[insulted] You know how many years it's been since I worked Catch a Rising Star? 

C.J. 
You made the joke, and inoffensive as you think it may have been, there was enormous 
pressure on the candidate to disavow your remarks and he did not.

COREY 
And I'm supposed to be... 

C.J. 
Corey... 

COREY 
And I'm supposed to feel good about that? That he didn't disavow me? That I wasn't 
disavowed? 

C.J. 
We were courting law enforcement, Corey. Don't be naive. 

COREY 
You were also courting the black vote, C.J.. I'm not naive. 

C.J. 
What did you expect us to do? 

COREY 
I expected that when I was called, in any number of places, a Hollywood sleaze, that 
you might have said a few words, maybe, on my behalf. I expected that you were going 
to say, "We in the Bartlet campaign don't believe Cornelius Sykes is a Hollywood sleaze. 
We believe he's a world class humorist and millions of Americans agree. We believe his 
humor can be disconcerting to some but those who are making noise right now are feigning 
their concern in an effort to frighten white men." But what you said was, "He didn't 
laugh at the joke." 

C.J. 
Corey... 

COREY 
He did laugh at the joke. 

C.J. 
Yeah. 

COREY 
He laughed at the joke, C.J.. I've been doing this 20 years. You don't think I'd know 
if I had him? I killed that night. That was a very big deal for me. To play in front 
of that audience? To get that man to laugh? And the next day my parents read in the 
paper that I am Hollywood sleaze. But that's okay cause the candidate didn't think I 
was funny. 

C.J. 
[looking uncomfortable] I understand.

COREY 
I don't want to cause any trouble for the President. You knew that when you walked in 
here. I'll pass on the dinner. I'll tell'em it's cause I can't get out of a booking. 
But the President laughed at the joke, C.J. I killed that night. 

C.J. 
[smiling] You did. Okay, I gotta go.

MARBURY 
No, in fact there's little honor attached to it at all.

DONNA 
Tell me about yourself. 

MARBURY 
Well, my mother was a descendant of the third of the nine children of Victoria. 
Victoria was the granddaughter of George the third, who was the great-grandson of 
George the first. George the first was the great-nephew of Charles the first, who 
was the son of James the first, and James' mother was Mary, Queen of Scots.

An Apache helicopter will not stop a Shahab 3 longrange stiletto, or a North Korean ICBM.

Sam passes by outside.

TOBY
Well so far neither can anything else. [calling outside] Hey, Sam? 

LEO 
I'm going back in there.

Toby walks out of office and up to Sam.

TOBY
Have you been getting questions? 

SAM 
I'm sorry? 

TOBY 
Have you been getting questions? 

SAM 
Yeah. 

TOBY 
From the press, or...?

SAM 
The press'll be tomorrow.

TOBY 
So who's asking?

SAM
The chairman of the GDC. Four Congressmen. The Secretary of the Interior. Who'd you 
think would be talking to me?

TOBY
Then what did you...?

SAM
I said, "Sometimes friends have to be honest with each other." I said exactly what you 
told me to say, which, coincidentally, is exactly C.J. told me to say, which is 
remarkable when you consider that C.J. was in New York during the event and didn't 
speak to you afterward. I mean, it's almost as if there were people who knew it was 
going to happen.

TOBY
Sam...

SAM
Get away from me.

Sam walks out of office and to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. He stands for a moment, then the 
door opens and Charlie walks out.

CHARLIE
Hey, Sam.

SAM
Is it possible I could get in for just a minute?

Toby appears in the hallway looking in. He shakes his head at Charlie.

CHARLIE
He's pretty tight right now. I don't think I can get you in.

Sam looks over his shoulder and spots Toby, who walks away. Sam gives Charlie a betrayed 
look, then leaves.

CUT TO: INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT
Music is playing. Donna and Marbury are chatting. 

MARBURY 
Oh, well, yes. Oh, certainly. There's uh, Edward, Earl of Ulster. He's the son of 
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who's the son of Henry, Duke of Gloucester. 

DONNA 
Edward, Earl of Ulster? 

MARBURY 
Yes. 

DONNA 
Do you think he'd like me? 

MARBURY 
Do you date younger men? 

DONNA 
Sure. How old is he? 

MARBURY 
Five. 

DONNA 
Okay, well let's stick a pin in that for a moment and move on. 

Leo walks up. 

LEO 
Hello. 

DONNA 
Hello. 

LEO 
Am I interrupting? 

MARBURY 
Not at all. 

DONNA 
Ambassador Marbury was just telling me about how royal men are schooled in the ways of 
courtship. King George III, for example, sailed his bride up the river Thames to music 
that was specially composed. 

LEO 
Yeah. That was just a few years before we opened up a big can of whoopass on him at 
Yorktown. 

MARBURY 
Leo, I- [as Donna slips away] 

LEO 
How can you look at North Korea, which 24 months ago fired a Taepodong missile...? 

MARBURY 
Uh, which failed...

LEO 
And with some modifications it'll be able to reach Alaska. 

MARBURY
Well I don't live in Alaska, I live in England, which by the way is not protected by 
the shield. Not that anywhere else is at the moment, either. You've also forgotten that 
we're both signatories to the '72 ABM treaty, which the shield is in clear violation. 
You've forgotten that it will compel China to strengthen their nuclear arsenal. You've 
forgotten that the European allies have strong reservations about the shield. And you've 
forgotten that it doesn't work.

LEO
You know what I haven't forgotten?

MARBURY
What?

LEO 
That we opened up a big can of whoopass on you at Yorktown!

MARBURY
All right.

CHARLIE 
[coming up to them] Leo?

LEO
Excuse me.

MARBURY
Excuse me.

DONNA
[passing by Charlie] I'm going to correspond with Edward, Earl of Ulster, once he 
learns how to read and write.

CHARLIE
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Sam is having a drink. Alice, the waitress, comes up.

ALICE
Here you go.

TOBY
No, no, Alice. I got it.

SAM
It's all right.

TOBY
No, I got it.

ALICE
You want a beer?

TOBY
Yeah. Thanks.

He hands her money, and she leaves.

TOBY
You don't ever go into the Oval Office mad.

SAM
Look...

TOBY
No, no, no. No, Sam. You don't ever go in there mad.

SAM
I think the President's remarks were ill advised, to say the least.

TOBY
You're wrong.

SAM
The drop-in's the story now, Toby, not the energy package.

TOBY
The energy package doesn't need to be a story; it's going to be a law.

SAM
You don't think we're going to need the environmental lobby?

TOBY
I think we need them, I just don't think we're going to lose them.

SAM
And I think you're tragically misguided.

TOBY
Sam...

SAM 
Many, if not most, environmentalists are absolutists who will use this insult to pull 
their support under cover we cut a deal in Detroit.

TOBY
Well then they can grow up, Sam. Use this insult? They just got the energy package they 
wanted, they just got the president at their dinner, and they should shut up!

SAM
Well you should explain it to them just that way, Toby, cause they're really pretty 
receptive to that argument.

TOBY
When they look down the ballot and see the alternatives, they get receptive in a hurry.

SAM
Was there anything else, or can I sit here now?

TOBY
[standing to leave] You can sit here. I'll see you tomorrow.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Sam, I'm looking at opposition polling that scares the hell out of me. I'm looking at 
internal numbers that change by the hour. I'm listening to economists that tell me 
there's weather...

SAM 
You left me out. 

TOBY 
[sighing] Yeah. 

SAM 
You think I'm the reason you got beat on the Leadership Breakfast?

TOBY
I got creamed, Sam.

SAM
You think I'm the reason?

TOBY 
I don't want that discussion. 

SAM 
Then what are you doing here talking to me? Now you want the discussion. You and the 
president may think they deserved it, but this cynicism of attacking your friends for 
political protection offends them and it offends me. It offends you, and there's really 
nothing I can do to make you feel better about that. 

TOBY 
We can't govern if we don't win. 

SAM 
You should've talked to me about the numbers more. 

TOBY
Anyway. I have this beer...

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
I was just gonna sit down and drink it.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
I mean, we don't have to talk or anything.

SAM
Yeah.

Toby and Sam sit in silence.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet walks in and speaks to Leo and Josh, who are waiting for him.

BARTLET
That was Chairwoman Shelly Lubis I just got off the phone with. Before that was a 
conference call with Jamie Schwartz of the Environmental Defense Fund, Bryce Davis 
of the Sierra Club, and three Democratic Congressman from the Subcommittee on Energy 
and the Environment. The number of different words they had for "manipulative," 
Leo, there's no way they didn't have a thesaurus open in front of them. Bryce Davis 
said if I keep this up, he's going to encourage Seth Gillette in a thirdparty bid.

LEO
What'd you say?

BARTLET
I said for fifty bucks and a ride to the airport, Gillette could have the job right now.

LEO
What'd you say?

BARTLET
I politely reminded him that it's probably not a good idea to threaten the president. 
[yelling] Nancy! [to Leo] I want to know when you're pushing me towards the missile 
shield it's not because you want me to look strong on defense.

NANCY
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
Would you tell Charlie I'm ready?

NANCY
Yes, sir.

LEO
I'm not. I'm pushing you to the missile defense shield cause I think it works.

BARTLET
Based on what?

LEO
Confidence. And the understanding that there's been a time in the evolution of everything 
that works when it didn't work.

JOSH
You know, can I say this? Why don't we just give the sixty billion dollars to North Korea 
in exchange for not bombing us?

BARTLET
It's almost hard to believe that you're not on the National Security Council.

JOSH
I know. I feel like they're missing an important voice.

The door opens. Lord Marbury enters with entourage.

TOM
Mr. President?

MARBURY
Good evening!

BARTLET
John! Let me explain why you've been waiting. I have to see people in the order they 
arrive, and you got beat by Argentina.

MARBURY
Oh, uhh... Well, yes.

BARTLET 
You also lost out on preferred seating for the State of the Union. 

MARBURY 
I'm required to attend the State of the Union? 

BARTLET 
Yes! 

MARBURY 
Then attend it I shall. 

BARTLET 
Okay. Tom? 

TOM
Mr. President, it is with pleasure I present His Excellency, Lord John Marbury of 
Great Britain, and by request of the Secretary of State, ask that you accept his 
credentials from Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, as Great Britain's Ambassador 
to the United States. 

Bartlet takes the folder from Marbury.

BARTLET
Where are you on the missile shield?

MARBURY
Well, I think it's dangerous, illegal... fiscally irresponsible, technologically unsound, 
and a threat to all people everywhere.

BARTLET
Leo?

LEO
I think the world invented a nuclear weapon. I think the world owes it to itself to see 
if it can't invent something that would make it irrelevant.

MARBURY
Well, that's the right sentiment, certainly a credible one from a man who's fought in a 
war. You think you can make it stop? Well, you can't. We build a shield, and somebody 
will build a better missile.

BARTLET
Well, it's a discussion for serious men. They say a statesman is a politician who's 
been dead for fifteen years. I'd like us to be statesmen while we're still alive. 
Lord Marbury, I accept your letter of credence from Queen Elizabeth, and, by affixing 
my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary.

They shake hands.

MARBURY
Well, thank you, sir.

Marbury turns and shakes hands with Leo.

LEO
Congratulations.

MARBURY
God Bless America.

LEO
God Save the Queen.

BARTLET
Let's go.

The photographers snap pictures of Bartlet and Marbury as they pose.
