TEASER

MARTIN SHEEN
Good evening, I'm Martin Sheen, and I'm with the cast of The West Wing. For those of you 
who tuned in tonight to see our season premiere, I'm afraid you won't. That'll be next week.

ROB LOWE
We're eager to get back to our continuing storylines, but tonight we wanted to stop for 
a moment and do something different.

ALLISON JANNEY
You'll notice a few things different about this show tonight, for instance, in place of 
our usual main title sequence, we'll be putting phone numbers up on the screen where you 
can pledge donations to groups that are able to help with victims' assistance.

JOHN SPENCER
By now, nobody needs to be convinced that when they named New York's finest and New York's 
bravest, they knew what they were talking about. So we're pleased to tell you that the 
profits of tonight's episode will be donated to New York firefighters, 9/11 Disaster 
Relief Fund, and the New York Police and Fire, widows and children's benefit fund.

DULE HILL
A helping hand from our family to theirs.

BRADLEY WHITFORD
Now, don't panic! We're in show business, and we'll get back to tending our egos in 
short order. But tonight we offer a play. It's called "Isaac and Ishmael." We suggest 
you don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out where this episode comes in in the 
timeline of the series. It doesn't. It's a story-telling aberration, if you'll allow.

RICHARD SCHIFF
Next week, we'll start our third season. That's when you'll see stories about a 
reelection campaign, an MS disclosure, an embassy in Haiti...

STOCKARD CHANNING
Repealing the estate tax...

ROB LOWE
A fight against Big Tobacco...

DULE HILL
A fight to get our friends back...

JOHN SPENCER
Funding the NEA...

ALLISON JANNEY
A veto override...

STOCKARD CHANNING
A marriage in trouble...

JANEL MOLONEY
And I get a boyfriend.

MARTIN SHEEN
That's all for us. Thank you for listening.

FADE TO: INT. FBI OFFICE - NIGHT

	FBI FIELD OFFICE
	BURLINGTON, VERMONT

In a series of offices, people are at their desks, flags hanging off walls. 
A man, Greg, walks in, comes up to woman by a computer.

GREG
Joan? Run a search in the NCIC. "Yaarun Nabi" - Y-a-a-r-u-n N-a-b-i.

JOAN
Yaarun Nabi is a Persian name.

GREG
Yeah?

JOAN
Means "friend of the prophet." [runs search, gets a few results]

GREG
Getting anything?

JOAN
Four AKAs. [reads] Yaquin Kashani, Raqim Ali, Yamin Bandari, Yawar Aryanpur.

GREG
Run them.

JOAN 
[runs the search] I wonder if they all mean "friend of the prophet." Guess that 
would be silly, or at least remarkably coincidental, that the aliases would mean 
the same thing as the actual name. I mean, you gotta ask what good would an 
alias be if it... [cuts off, gestures for Greg to come closer] Greg?

Greg approaches, looks at the screen, then dials a number on the phone. 

GREG
[into phone] Get me the Secret Service Joint Operations' center of the White House. 

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh picks up his bag.

JOSH
Donna!

Donna comes to the door.

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
I'm going home.

DONNA
It's only five.

JOSH
Yeah, I know.

DONNA
You can't go yet, you have to talk to the students.

JOSH
What students?

DONNA
From Presidential Classroom?

JOSH
What are you talking about?

DONNA
They're high school kids from across the country who were accepted for... 
I don't know, they come to Washington for four days, they get to meet with 
interesting people and you're one of them.

JOSH
[puts on coat] When did... When did this get on the schedule?

DONNA 
[comes inside] It's been there.

JOSH
No, it hasn't, it just... There isn't anybody else who can do this?

DONNA
It's supposed to be you.

JOSH
I have to work.

DONNA
You can work in the office.

JOSH
No, I can't work in the office! 

He walks out, Donna follows into the bullpen.

JOSH
We've crashed five times in the last three weeks. When I'm not being evacuated 
from the building, I'm not being allowed to leave the building and now, the one... 
God, Donna, I wanna go home.

DONNA
Josh, it's been on your schedule.

JOSH 
[stops] All right, I'll give them a few minutes, but then I gotta go, ok?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH 
[sighs] When am I supposed to do this?

DONNA
Now.

JOSH
Where are they?

DONNA
They're right in the North-West lobby.

Josh hands her his bag and walks out.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
A group of students and their teachers are standing as Josh walks in.

JOSH
Good evening! Good to see you... you're the group from Presidential... something?

DONNA
[from behind] Classroom.

JOSH
Classroom?

MARJORIE MANN
I'm their supervisor, Marjorie Mann.

JOSH
Josh Lyman.

MARJORIE 
[shakes his hand] Thank you for taking the time.

JOSH
So, how'd you all get here?

STUDENTS
Bus.

JOSH
I meant...

MARJORIE
They qualified with essays, recommendations, grades in history and government. 
It's very competitive.

JOSH
All right, I'm Josh Lyman, I'm the Deputy White House Chief of Staff, I joined the 
Bartlet campaign shortly before the Iowa Caucus, then served as the campaign's 
political director. Before that, I worked with then Senator John Hoynes for a while...

DONNA
Josh...

JOSH
[turns] Yeah? 

He looks at the red phone on the table, its incoming call button is flashing. 
The security guard picks up the red phone with a sticker "Crash" on the receiver.

GUARD
Station One. Code Black, crash!

JOSH 
[to students] All right, listen, something's about to happen. Don't let it frighten you, 
they need to seal the building.

Secret Service agents burst in through all doors. 

AGENT 1
Stay where you are, please.

AGENT 2
Everybody, please, stay where you are.

GUAR
Mr Lyman? These kids with you?

JOSH
Yeah, I guess they are. [to students] Something's happened.

FADE OUT.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Donna leads the school kids into the mess from a hallway right outside.

DONNA
Right in here. Just grab a seat anywhere. Right in here. This is the mess. 
This is where we eat lunch. We'll just... wait here.

Josh walks up from behind Donna.

JOSH
What's going on?

DONNA
How should I know?

JOSH
Would you call Leo's office and find out what's going on, and, more important, 
how long it's going to be going on for?

DONNA
They're probably scared. You might try lightening up a little bit.

JOSH
Yeah, I'll definitely give that a try. 

Josh and Donna follow the rest of the kids into the mess. Josh stands in front 
of the kids and addresses them. 

JOSH
Okay, well, uh, this is called a "crash." It means there's been some kind of 
security breach and no one's allowed in or out of the building. 

Josh turns around, smacking his hands together nervously, and looks at Donna, 
who is standing behind him.

JOSH
Would you call Leo's office? 

Donna goes off to a side room, and picks up a phone.

JOSH
So, I guess we should use this time. Uh, this is the White House, the home of the 
President and the Executive Branch, the most powerful of the three branches of 
the federal government. 

Josh is pacing back and forth in front of the students. One of them raises his hand 
to ask a question.

JOSH
Yeah.

BILLY
Actually, Mr. Lyman, isn't it true that the Framers made sure that the Executive 
Branch was the weakest of the three branches? Because we were breaking off from the 
royalist model that put absolute power in just one place. I mean, isn't that why they 
made the Legislative branch-or People's Branch-the most powerful?

Josh stops in front of Billy, and acts vaguely menacing, a little smirk on his face, 
and Donna can be seen reentering in the background.

JOSH
What's your name?

BILLY
[with a slight hesitation] I'm Billy Fernandez.

JOSH
I'll call you Fred. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. I don't know how long 
we're all going to be here, but you just made my list. 

Billy smiles, and Josh walks off, continuing.

JOSH
Yes, I suppose, technically, constitutionally the Legislative Branch is the most 
powerful, but we get a motorcade, so back off. All right, you already know about the 
branches of government, I assume you know how a bill becomes a law. What do you want 
to talk about? 

The kids make no response, they seem nervous.

JOSH
Guys, seriously, it's nothing to worry about. We've been having these crashes once a week. 
Let's go. Somebody ask me something.

A girl pipes up from the group.

GIRL 1
So... what's the deal with everybody trying to kill you?

JOSH
Well... it's not everybody, and they're trying to kill you, too.

GIRL 1
But mostly you.

JOSH
No, both of us the same. Let's go, it doesn't have to be about politics. You're off 
to college. I'm the guy who knows what you need to know. Sophomore year, my roommates 
and I got a fish registered for 18 credits, and she made Dean's List. My roommates and 
I made a Dean's List of a different sort, but that doesn't matter.

Another boy, behind Billy, pipes up.

BOY 1
Do you get scared coming to work at the White House?

JOSH
No. I mean, we're bystanders, basically, and we work around a lot of people who 
routinely put themselves in harm's way-the Secret Service and the military. 
You know, the protection detail? They practice a thousand different scenarios 
for a gun: who tackles the president, who opens the car, who's covering the 
perimeter, and there's one guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet. 
Not get the shooter-stand in front of the bullet. I've seen him do it.

GIRL 1
Do you ever think about quitting?

JOSH
No. [hesitates for a moment, and continues] Well... my, uh... my mother wants me to. 
My family members have a habit of, uh, dying before you're supposed too. So it's 
just me and my mom now and... You guys know I guess, that I got accidentally shot 
a little bit or something at Rosslyn. So, she'd like to see me in the private sector. 
But I tell her my government salary may not be a lot, but I still make more than 
the guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet, so how do I tell him I'm 
quitting? So she made me this box that I'm supposed to keep in the trunk of my car, 
and it's got a super-powered flashlight, five gallons of water, and a transistor 
radio, and some first aid. But she keeps thinking of things to add to it. She'll 
call and say, uh, "I found that cap that Dad got Joe Pepitone to sign for you on 
your birthday. You wore it to school every day in the seventh grade. You want me 
to send it to you so you can put it in the box?" 

Josh has trailed off a bit, and stops for a moment, looking sad and serious. 
He looks around the room for a moment. He starts up again, livelier.

JOSH
So... I'll say "Yeah, Ma, let's put it in the box." 

Josh gives a little chuckle. He walks over, leaning against something by the wall.

JOSH
So anyway, I... I don't know against who, and I don't know what it's going to look like, 
but one of these days we're gonna have a big win, and for a lot of us who've seen what 
we've seen, we're not leaving till we do. I'm gonna be here six presidents from now, 
in my office, Wile E. Coyote and a map.

GIRL 2
So why is everybody trying to kill us?

JOSH
It's not everybody.

GIRL 2
It seems like everybody.

BOY 2
It's just the Arabs.

BOY 1
Saying the Arabs is too general.

BOY 2
It's Islamic.

JOSH
It's not Arabs. It's not Islamics. [to Donna] They're juniors and seniors? 

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
You're juniors and seniors. [heads over to a dry erase board across the room] 
In honor of the SAT's you're about to take, answer the following question. 

He erases the board, and Donna hands him a marker.

JOSH
Thanks. Islamic extremist is to Islamic as "blank" is to Christianity. 

Josh writes this on the board as he speaks it again to the kids. 

JOSH
Islamic... extremist... is to... Islamic... as... "blank" is... to Christianity.

BOY 2
Christian Fundamentalists.

JOSH
No.

BOY 3
Jehovah's Witnesses?

JOSH
No. Guys, the Christian right may not be your cup of tea, but they're not blowing 
stuff up. "Islamic extremist is to Islamic as "blank is to Christianity." 

No one responds. Josh turns around and writes "KKK" on the dry erase board, and circles it.

JOSH
That's what we're talking about. It's the Klan, gone medieval and global. It couldn't 
have less to do with Islamic men and women of faith of whom there are millions upon 
millions. Muslims defend this country in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, 
National guard, police and fire departments. So, let's ask the question again.

GIRL 1
Why are Islamic Extremists trying to kill us?

JOSH
That's a reasonable question if ever I heard one. Why are we targets of war? 

BOY 2
Because we're Americans.

JOSH
That's it?

GIRL 3
Because of our freedom?

JOSH
No other reasons? 

BOY 3
Freedom and democracy.

JOSH
I'll tell you, right or wrong-and I think they're wrong-it's probably a good idea to 
acknowledge that they do have specific complaints. I-I hear them every day-the people 
we support, troops in Saudi Arabia, sanctions against Iraq, support for Egypt. 
It's not just that they don't like Irving Berlin.

DONNA
Yes, it is.

JOSH
No, it's not. 

DONNA
No, not about Irving Berlin, but your ridiculous search for rational reasons why 
somebody straps a bomb to their chest is ridiculous.

JOSH
You just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence. 

DONNA
Hardly a record for me.

JOSH
And you just made my list.

DONNA
[to the kids] Nothing happens on the list.

JOSH
It's a serious list. But she does have a point, albeit college girlish.

DONNA
Watch now, as he's going to put me down and make my point at the exact same time.

JOSH
Hardly a record for me. What's Islamic extremism? It's strict adherence to a particular 
interpretation of 7th century Islamic law as practiced by the prophet Mohammed, and 
when I say "strict adherence," I'm not kidding around. Men are forced to pray, wear 
their beards a certain length. Among my favorites is there's only one acceptable cheer 
at a soccer match: Allah-uh-Akbar-God is great. If your guys are getting creamed, 
then you're on your own. Things are a lot less comic for women, who aren't allowed 
to attend school or have jobs. They're not allowed to be unaccompanied, and oftentimes 
get publicly stoned to death for crimes like not wearing a veil. I don't have to tell 
you they don't need to shout at a soccer match because they're never going to go to one. 
So what bothers them about us? Well, the variety of cheers alone coming from the cheap 
seats at Giants stadium when they're playing the Cowboys is enough for a jihad, to say 
nothing of street corners lined church next to synagogue, next to mosque, newspapers 
that can print anything they want, women who can do anything they want including taking 
a rocket ship to outer space, vote, and play soccer. This is a plural society. That 
means we accept more than one idea. It offends them. So yes, she does have a point, 
but that certainly doesn't mean you should listen to her.

GIRL 3
So... what do we do now?

JOSH
What?

GIRL 3
What do we do now?

JOSH
Well, I think for help with that question we're going to need some people smarter than I am.

DONNA
Definitely.

JOSH
Thing is... that's pretty tough to find. But I'm going to go upstairs and see if I can 
get some of my friends to come down and join us. Listen, I-I don't know what's going on 
and I don't know how long we're going to be here. Are you guys hungry?

GIRL 1
Yeah.

JOSH
Freddy, why don't you grab a couple of people, go to the back of the kitchen, get apples 
and peanut butter? Guys, I've gotten entire pieces of legislation through Congress on 
apples and peanut butter. I'll be back in a little bit.

Josh exits the mess.

CUT TO: INT. A DARKENED OFFICE ROOM - NIGHT
A man, clearly of Arab decent, sits by a window, smoking a cigarette. 

	5:22 PM, OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING.

Out in the HALLWAY, Ron Butterfield and four other Secret Service men walk quickly to 
the room where the man is. The man continues to smoke, until he hears the doorknob 
to the room rattling behind him, and he tosses his cigarette out the window. A Secret 
Service agent kicks in the door, gun drawn for firing. The agents hurry into the room, 
and the man looks startled.

AGENT 1
Secret Service, don't move!

RON
Show us your hands. Do it now. 

The man puts his hands up. He is clearly frightened.

RON
Are you Raqim Ali?

RAQIM ALI
Yes. The-there's-

RON
Stay calm. I'm Special Agent Ron Butterfield of the United States Secret Service. 
Keep your hands over your head and step away from the window. We're going to ask you 
some questions.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo and Ron Butterfield enter. Ron waits for Leo to close all the doors before speaking.

RON
Five hours ago, Khuram Sharif was taken into custody while crossing from Ontario into 
Vermont. There was a warrant for his arrest in connection with an attempted bombin at 
LaGuardia. Turning State's evidence over to the U.S. Attorney, he named several 
coconspirators. One of whom was Yaarun Nabi. A preliminary check in the NCIC kicked out 
five aliases. One of which was Raqim Ali. There are three Raqim Alis. One's a software 
designer in Spokane. Another is a caterer in Los Angeles.

LEO
Who's the third?

RON
He works in the White House.

Leo is surprised, almost speechless.

LEO
It was only a matter of time, huh?

RON
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. DARK OFFICE - NIGHT
The Raqim Ali that works in the White House is seated at a table. Several agents are around, 
one of whom is asking him questions.

AGENT
Have you ever heard of Khuram Sharif?

ALI
Yes. He was arrested in connection with an attempted bombing of one of the New York airports. 
I think he may have also been arrested once in Patterson, New Jersey.

AGENT
Patterson means something to you?

ALI
I was born there.

AGENT
Where did you go to school?

ALI
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics.

Leo suddenly walks in with Ron. He looks at Ali.

LEO
You know who I am?

ALI
Of course I know who you are.

Leo nods to the agent.

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Toby is now in front of the group of children.

TOBY
Kill them all. Yeah.

BOY 1
All the Islamic Extremists?

TOBY
No, no. I mean everyone. You're all bothering me. I want to be left alone. Clearly, the only 
way that's gonna happen is to be alone. So I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to let you all go. 
[pause] Except the Yankees and the Knicks... and the Yankees and the Knicks are gonna need 
someone to play, so keep the Red Sox and the Lakers... and the Laker girls, and The Palm, 
and we'll need to keep the people who work at The Palm. That's it though. The Yankees, the 
Red Sox, the Knicks, the Lakers, the Laker girls, and anyone who works at The Palm. Sports, 
Laker girls, and a well-prepared steak. That's all I need... Sometimes, I like to mix it up 
with Italian... and Chinese. All right, you can all stay, but don't bug me. You're on 
probation. Don't forget. I was this close to banishing you.

JOSH
This is Toby Ziegler, and actually, he's in charge of crafting our message to the public.

TOBY
And today, that message is?

BOY 1
Don't bug me?

TOBY
That's right.

GIRL 1
Nice beard.

TOBY
My choice, sister. And by the way, there's nothing wrong with a religion whose laws say a 
man's got to wear a beard or cover his head or wear a collar. It's when violation of these 
laws become a crime against the State and not your parents that we're talking about lack of 
choice. [looks at the visual aid, reads] "Islamic Extremists is to Islamic as KKK is to 
Christianity." That's... that's about right. That's a good religious analogy. What's the 
political analogy? What's an analogy using governments?

BOY 1
They don't have a government.

BOY 2
They have the Taliban. They have the government of Afghanistan.

TOBY
The Taliban is not the recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban took over the 
recognized government of Afghanistan. And there's your political analogy.

BOY 2
What do you mean?

TOBY
When you think of Afghanistan, think of Poland. When you think of the Taliban, think of the 
Nazis. When you think of the citizens of Afghanistan, think of the Jews in concentration camps. 
A friend of my dad's was at one of the camps. He used to come over to the house, and he and 
my dad used to shoot some pinochle. He said he once saw a guy at the camp kneeling and praying. 
He said, "What are you doing?" The guy said he was thanking God. And my dad's friend said, 
"What could you possibly be thanking God for?" He said, "I'm thanking God for not making me 
like them." Bad people can't be recognized on sight. There's no point in trying.

JOSH
Actually, we already covered that.

TOBY
It's worth covering twice, don't you agree?

JOSH
I do.

A girl raises her hand to get Toby's attention.

TOBY
Yeah.

GIRL 2
Pinochle's a card game?

TOBY
[pause] Yeah, I've changed my mind again. Kill them all.

JOSH
Laker girls?

TOBY
No, all right.

BOY 1
What was the first act of terrorism?

TOBY
[to Josh] What was the first act of terrorism?

JOSH
I could answer, but I think he's asking you, man.

TOBY
[sighs] I-I know it's not new. I know in the eleventh century... I'm gonna have trouble 
pronouncing this, in the eleventh century, [sighs] secret followers of Al-hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah, 
who were taught to believe in nothing and dare all, carried out these very swift and very 
treacherous murders of fellow Muslims, and they did it in the state of religious ecstasy.

Sam walks in behind, looking around.

TOBY [cont.]
As a matter of fact, young men between 12 and 20 were given hashish, and uh, smuggled into a... 
I really don't know what they call it, they were smuggled into a kind of specially designed 
pleasure garden complete with concubines. They were told this was paradise, and that the 
Master's Angels would carry them back if they carried out murders of the Master's enemies.

SAM
Ah, temptation. I have named thee, and thy name is woman.

JOSH
This is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director. Now, don't be frightened when I tell you 
that in this room, Sam is the knowledgeable terrorism expert. The good news is in this 
government, we have some extremely knowledgeable terrorism experts.

SAM
I heard I was needed, I came.

TOBY
We were talking about Al-, am I pronouncing this right? Al-Hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah?

SAM
Yeah, from the eleventh century.

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
By the way, the Arabic name for their secret order has survived until today. Can anybody guess 
what it was? Their Arabic name. [points to a boy] You know.

BOY 3
Assassins?

SAM
Assassins. That's right.

JOSH
Yeah, we don't call on him.

Laughter.

TOBY
[to Sam] What's going on?

SAM
There's supposed to be a meeting at Treasury.

TOBY
I had a 6:00 on the Hill, now I'm stuck here, you know, talking with well-dressed children 
who can't vote.

GIRL 1
You know a lot about terrorism?

SAM
I dabble.

GIRL 1
What are you struck by most?

SAM
It's 100% failure rate.

GIRL 1
Really?

SAM
Not only do terrorists always fail at what they're after, they pretty much always succeed in 
strengthening whatever it is they're against.

BOY 1
What about the IRA?

SAM
The Brits are still there. The Protestants are still there. Basque extremists have been staging 
terrorist attacks in Spain for decades with no result. Left Wing Red Brigades from the 60s and 
70s, from the Bader-Meinhoff gang in Germany to the Weatherman in the U.S. have tried to take 
over capitalism. You tell me. How's capitalism doing?

BOY 2
What about non-violent protest?

SAM
What about it?

BOY 2
Well, it worked for Gandhi.

SAM
Yeah, it did. Who else did it work for?

BOY 1
The Civil Rights Movement.

SAM
That's right.

GIRL 1
Yeah, but weren't we terrorists at the Boston Tea Party?

SAM
Nobody got hurt at the Boston Tea Party. The only people that got hurs was some fancy boys 
who didn't have anything to wash down their crumpets with. We jumped out from behind bushes, 
while the British came down the road in their bright red jackets, but never has a war been 
so courteously declared. It was on parchment with calligraphy and "Your highness, we beseech 
you on this day in Philadelphia to bite me, if you please."

GIRL 1
Can I go back to what you were saying at the beginning?

SAM
Yeah.

GIRL 1
About it being 100% ineffective.

SAM
Yeah.

GIRL 1
They're still doing it anyway.

SAM
Yeah.

GIRL 1
They're not frustrated by the failure?

SAM
No.

GIRL 1
Well, what do you call a soceity that has to just live everyday with the idea that the pizza 
place you're eating in can just blow up without any warning?

SAM
Israel.

CUT TO: INT. DARK OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is now seated across Raqim Ali, doing the questioning.

LEO
Can you tell us about the wire in your backpack?

ALI
My apartment is in an older building. It's for my computer. I needed the older telephone wires 
so I could upgrade the M-waves on my motherboard.

LEO
You're an expert in circuitry and wiring?

ALI
My father works for the phone company.

LEO
I want to talk about the applied mathematics degree.

ALI
Yeah?

LEO
What are you doing working for a White House staffer secretary?

ALI
I-... What do you mean?

LEO
We don't do a lot of math around here.

ALI
Well, my interests shifted, I became interested in policy.

LEO
You're aware that the intelligence agencies routinely recruit top mathematicians, oftentimes 
out of M.I.T. and train them to be cryptographers.

ALI
Sure.

LEO
And those cryptographers are the ones who, on a daily basis, code and decode messages sent 
between the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon.

ALI
Yes.

Leo puts on his glasses, picks up the papers on the table and looks at them. A moment later, 
he takes off his glasses and looks up at Ali.

LEO
Last year, your father made a contribution to something called the Holy Land Defender. 
Were you aware of the contribution?

ALI
Mr. McGarry, I understand the need for these questions, and I hope you notice I've been 
cooperating, but if you drag my father into this pitiful exercise, I'm afraid I'm gonna 
get angry.

LEO
I don't think you understand the seriousness of what's happening right now. 

He puts on his glasses again and looks down at the papers.

ALI
I don't think you do.

Leo looks up at him for a second, then down to the papers again.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE MESS - NIGHT
The conversation continues. C.J. is now part of it.

JOSH
No, no, no, no. You walked into quicksand.

TOBY
You don't talk to C.J. about the CIA.

SAM
You just don't do it.

JOSH
C.J. has a bizarre affection for the intelligence community that we just don't...

C.J.
Bizarre? How about right?

JOSH
Okay.

C.J.
This song is called, "The CIA, Our Maligned Little Brother."

SAM
Oh God.

C.J.
We need spies; human spies. Spy satellites are great if you're trying to detect 
whether or not Kruschev's put missiles in Cuba. But if you want to overhear a 
conversation over Turkish coffee in Khyber Pass, you need a spy. You guys want to 
great a great job after college and serve your country? Study Arabic, Chinese and Farsi.

TOBY
Maybe this'd be a good time for a chorus of "Our Maligned Little Brother, Civil Liberties."

C.J.
Liberties, schmiberties.

TOBY
C.J. Cregg, ladies and gentlemen.

C.J.
You know the way to do this without tapping some phones?

TOBY
What about illegal searches? What about profiling? Do you know what Benjamin Franklin said?

C.J.
He said, "Hey, look, I've invented the stove."

BILLY
He said, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, 
deserve neither liberty nor safety."

C.J.
What's your name?

BILLY
Well...

JOSH
[to C.J.] I'm on it.

C.J.
Well, I don't think we're talking a little temporary safety and it's not like we need to 
search high and low for clear and present danger.

TOBY
Well, what would you say the point of fighting terrorism is?

C.J.
It's to insure freedom, Pokey. I don't need the brochure.

TOBY
I think you do cause during times of great crisis and threat, America has used Draconian 
measures before and I think maybe you've forgotten just how affective they've been. 
Can you name some?

GIRL 1
The blacklist.

TOBY
[points at C.J.] I want her to name them.

C.J. 
[quickly] The blacklist.

TOBY
Thank you.

C.J.
Look, I talk civil liberties as seriously as anybody, okay? I've been to the dinners 
and we haven't even talked about free speech yet and somebody getting lynched by the 
patriotism police for voicing a minority opinion. That said, Tobus, we're going to 
have to do some stuff. We're going to have to tap some phones and we're going to have 
to partner with some people who are the lesser of evils. I'm sorry but terrorists don't 
have armies and navies. They don't have capitals. Some of these guys we're going to have 
to walk up to them and shoot them. Yeah, we can root terrorist nests but some of these 
guys aren't going to be taken by the 105thn armored tank division. Some of these guys 
are going to be taken by a busboy with a silencer. So it's time to give the intelligence 
agencies the money and the manpower they need. We don't hear about their successes. 
Guess what? The Soviets never crossed the Elbe. The North Koreans stayed behind the 
38th parallel. During the Millennium? Not one incident. Do you think that's because 
the terrorists decided that'd be a good day to take off? Not much action that day? 
End of song.

CUT TO: INT. DARK OFFICE - NIGHT

AGENT
You were arrested two years ago?

ALI
Yes, and the charges were dropped.

AGENT
You were arrested for holding a rally without a permit.

ALI
I had a permit. It hadn't processed. And the charges were dropped.

LEO
What were you protesting.

ALI
The presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.

LEO
What exactly is your concern with our troops in Saudi Arabia?

ALI
Saudi Arabia is home to two of our holiest mosques. Mecca is there. How would you 
like it if I camped outside the Vatican with a stockpile of M-16s?

LEO
I'd like it fine if you were there to protect the Vatican.

ALI
Mister...

LEO
We sent our troops down there to make sure our friends didn't cross the Kuwaiti border 
and seize Saudi territory.

ALI
You mean Saudi Oil?

LEO
Yes, we have oil interests in the gulf. So does the rest of the world.

ALI
You sent an army composed of women as well as men to protect a Muslim dynasty where 
women aren't even allowed to drive a car.

LEO
Maybe we can teach them.

ALI 
[stares at Leo in anger and disbelief] Anyway, that's what I was protesting.

AGENT
You went to Edison High School in Patterson, correct?

ALI
Correct.

AGENT
On December 3, 1994, someone called in a bomb threat to the school.

ALI
Yeah, I remember that there were bomb threats. I remember that there were more than one, 
but I don't remember the exact dates.

AGENT
According to your transcripts, police questioned you.

ALI
Yeah, it's on my school transcript 'cause I wasn't arrested.

AGENT
So what did they ask you?

ALI
They asked if I called in a bomb threat, which I didn't.

AGENT
Do you know who did?

ALI
It was a couple of football players that didn't want to take a chem final.

AGENT
So it was a couple of football players but they called you in anyway?

ALI
It's not uncommon for Arab Americans to be the first suspected when that sort of thing 
happens.

LEO
I can't imagine why.

ALI
Look...

LEO
No, I'm trying to figure out why anytime there's any terrorist activity, people always 
assume its Arabs. I'm racking my brain.

ALI
I don't know the answer to that, Mr. McGarry, but I can tell you it's horrible.

LEO
Well, that's the price you pay.

ALI 
(angry) Excuse me? The price for what?

LEO 
(to the agent) Continue the questions.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE MESS - NIGHT
Toby walks out of the mess. Charlie stands in a doorway at the back of the room, 
his arms crossed, and watches as C.J. speaks to the students. She's seated on a stool 
at the front of the room. Josh is leaning on the counter next to her, and Sam is 
standing by the coffee area.

C.J.
There's nothing more American than coalition-building. The first thing John Wayne 
always did was put together a posse.

JOSH
That's a hell of an example, C.J.

C.J.
Shouldn't you be finding ways to provide aid and comfort for our boys in intelligence?

JOSH
You know, they may need some comforting right now. When this crash is over, you'd best 
get in some fishnets and head to a bar.

C.J.
I will. 

A student raises his hand.

JOSH
Yeah?

BOY 1
Where do terrorists come from? 

JOSH
Where do they come from?

SAM
Everywhere. Mostly they come from exactly where you'd expect: places of abject poverty 
and despair. Horribly impoverished places are an incubator for the worst kind of crime.

CHARLIE
Which is the same as it is right here.

Everyone turns to look at Charlie.

CHARLIE
Same as it is here. I live in Southeast D.C. If you don't know the area, think Compton, 
or South Central L.A., Detroit, the South Bronx. Dilapidated schools, drugs, guns, and 
what else?

BOY 1
Gangs?

CHARLIE
Gangs. Gangs give you a sense of belonging, and usually, an income. But mostly, they 
give you a sense of dignity. Men are men, and men'll seek pride. Everybody here's got 
a badge to wear. "I'm the Deputy Communications Director." "I made Presidential Classroom." 
"I know the answer. I'm going to Cornell." You think bangers are walking around with their 
heads down, saying, "Oh man, I didn't make anything out of my life. I'm in a gang." 
No, man! They're walking around saying, "Man, I'm in a gang. I'm with them."

A door to the mess is opened and several Secret Service agents walk into the room. 
The staff all stand as Bartlet and Abbey casually walk in, escorted by other agents. 
They stand next to each other at the front of the room.

STAFF
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hello...

MARJORIE
[whispering] Everyone, stand up.

The students all stand, albeit belatedly.

BARTLET
[to C.J.] What the hell's going on?

C.J.
Sir, this is a group of high school students from Presidential Classroom.

BARTLET
Ah... Please... 

Bartlet nods and gestures to the students to sit back down. 

BARTLET
You women seem bright and lovely. The men? Disturbingly dense.

The students laugh quietly.

ABBEY
Ignore him. God knows the rest of us do.

Charlie walks between the tables where the students are seated, toward the front of the room.

BARTLET
Excuse me... [to Charlie] Weren't you coming down to get me some apples and peanut butter?

CHARLIE
We're out of apples, sir.

Bartlet nods good-naturedly.

BARTLET
[to students] So, we're stuck here, huh?

BOY 2
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Well, I live here.

BOY 2
[laughing] Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[to C.J.] I'm going back to my office. Nice meeting you all.

ABBEY
[to Bartlet] I'm gonna stay here a few minutes.

Bartlet turns to leave as a student asks him a question.

BOY 1
Sir? 

BARTLET
[turns around] Yeah?

BOY 1
Do you consider yourself a man of principle?

BARTLET
[gently] I try to be.

BOY 1
Well, don't you consider...I mean, I know they're our enemy, but don't you consider 
there's something noble about being a martyr? 

BARTLET
[pauses, considers the question] A martyr would rather suffer death at the hands of 
an oppressor than renounce his beliefs. Killing yourself and innocent people to make 
a point is sick, twisted, brutal, dumb-ass murder. And let me leave you with this 
thought before I go searching for the apples that were rightfully mine: we don't need 
martyrs right now. We need heroes. A hero would die for his country but he'd much 
rather live for it... It was good meeting you all.

Bartlet leaves and Charlie follows him out, along with most of the agents.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President.

JOSH
Thank you, sir.

CUT TO: INT. OUTSIDE THE DARK OFFICE - NIGHT
Several FBI agents are standing in the hallway outside the meeting room where Ali is 
being interrogated. A Secret Service agent is standing next to the door, which is closed. 
A second agent approaches and whispers a message to the agent at the door. The first 
agent opens the door and enters the DARK OFFICE to confer with Ron. The second agent 
stands in the doorway, waiting. Ali glances around nervously as the agent speaks with 
Ron. Ali is being questioned by a third agent who is seated on the table across from him.

AGENT
Why were you in Uzbekistan?

ALI
It was my Russia trip. I went there with some friends after graduation.

AGENT
Could you tell me about the Islamic League of Allston?

ALI
It used to be my mosque.

The agent who entered the room speaks quietly with Ron and then leaves. Ron and the 
agent who has been questioning ALI confer with the agent who delivered the message.

AGENT MESSENGER
We found him.

RON
Where?

AGENT MESSENGER
Germany.

RON
[to the other agent, who is nodding] I'm fine.

Ron quickly leaves with the agent who delivered the message.

AGENT
Mr. Ali, you're free to go. Thank you.

ALI
Thank you.

Ali sighs heavily as everyone leaves, except Leo, who sits motionless in his chair 
and stares at Ali. Ali gets up to leave and is almost out the door when he stops, 
turns and walks back toward Leo.

ALI
You know what, Mr. McGarry? You have the memory of a gypsy moth. When you and the 
President and the President's daughter and about a hundred other people -- including me, 
by the way -- were met with a hail of .44-calibre gunfire in Rosslyn, not only were the 
shooters white... they were doing it because one of us wasn't.

Leo stares blankly ahead and only looks up as Ali leaves. Leo's expression changes 
slightly, a hint of sadness on his face.

CUT TO: INT. THE MESS - NIGHT
Abbey is sitting at the front of the room. Josh is sitting in a chair by the door, 
his arms crossed.

STUDENT
How did all this start?

ABBEY
How did what all start?

STUDENT
Well... this...

ABBEY
Sarah... God said to Abraham, "Look toward the heaven and number the stars and so 
shall your descendants be." But Abraham's wife, Sarah, wasn't getting any younger, 
and God wasn't coming through on His promise... I was very young when I had my kids. 
I was very, very, very, very young. I was barely even born yet when I had my oldest 
daughter, Elizabeth. 

Josh and the students laugh quietly. Abbey glances over at Josh, who is smiling at her.

ABBEY
Anyway, Sarah was getting older, and she was getting nervous because she didn't have 
any children. So she sent Abraham to the bed of her maid, Hagar, and Abraham and Hagar 
had Ishmael. And not long after they did, God kept His promise to Sarah, as He'd always 
intended to, and Abraham and Sarah had Isaac. And Sarah said to Abraham, "Cast out this 
slave woman with her son, for the son of the slave woman will not be heir with my son 
Isaac." And so it began: the Jews, the sons of Isaac. The Arabs, the sons of Ishmael. 
But what most people find important to remember is that, in the end, the two sons came 
together to bury their father.

JOSH
I think most people also find it important to remember that the whole thing took place 
about 73 million years ago.

ABBEY
Yeah.

DONNA
[walks in] Excuse me, ma'am. We're clear.

ABBEY
Well, that's that then. It was good talking with you guys. Hang in there.

Abbey stands up and leaves, along with several agents. Josh sits down in a chair near 
the front of the room.

JOSH
Well, all right. That's it then.

STUDENT
Can I ask one more question?

JOSH
Yeah.

STUDENT
Do you favor the death penalty?

JOSH
No.

STUDENT
But you think we should kill these people?

JOSH
You don't have the choices in a war that you do in a jury room. But I - I - I wish... 
wish we didn't have to. I think death is too simple.

STUDENT
What would do instead?

JOSH
I'd put 'em in a small cell, and make them watch home movies of the birthdays and baptisms 
and weddings of every single person they killed, over and over, every day, for the rest 
of their lives. [clears his throat] And then they'd get punched in the mouth every night 
at bedtime. By a different person, every night. There'd be a long list of volunteers, 
but that's all right. We'll wait...But listen, don't worry about all this right now. 
We got your covered. Worry about school. Worry about what you're gonna tell your parents 
when you break curfew. You're gonna meet guys, you're gonna meet girls... [looks at Billy] 
Not so much you, Fred.

The students chuckle weakly.

JOSH
Learn things. Be good to each other. Read the newspapers, go the movies, go to a party. 
Read a book. In the meantime, remember pluralism. You want to get these people? I mean, 
you really want to reach in and kill them where they live? Keep accepting more than one 
idea. Makes 'em absolutely crazy.

The students are all listening very intently.

JOSH
[good-naturedly] Go.

Josh stands up and shakes hands with the students and Marjorie as they file out.

JOSH
See you later. Okay.

MARJORIE
Thank you.

JOSH
Thank you. Thanks a lot. It was fun. Don't steal anything on the way out. Okay.

STUDENT
Bye-bye. 

Billy is one of the last to leave. 

JOSH
Billy. [gestures for him to wait] Listen...

Josh waits for the others to leave. Billy looks up at Josh expectantly.

JOSH
Nothing, just...just keep doing what you're doing.

BILLY
[almost whispering] Okay.

JOSH
Okay. [They shake hands.] See you.

BILLY
Bye.

Billy leaves, carrying his jacket. Josh turns, his hands in his pockets, 
and watches Billy leave.

CUT TO: INT. ALI'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo walks slowly inside. Ali is working at his desk.

LEO
[solemnly] Good evening.

Ali looks up.

LEO
[stiffly] That's the price you pay... for having the same physical features as criminals. 
That's what I was gonna say.

ALI
[quietly] No kidding.

LEO
I'm sorry about that. Also about the crack I made about teaching Muslim women how to drive. 

Ali looks down, taking this in. Leo, nervously, stiffly, his eyes wandering a bit, searches 
for the correct words.

LEO
I think if you talk to people who know me, they'd tell you that... that was unlike me, 
you know? We're obviously all under, um... a greater than usual amount of... you know. 
And like you pointed out, with the shooting and everything...

A long silence falls between them. Ali looks up and searches Leo's face.

LEO
Yeah. [nods slightly] All right. Well, that's all. 

Leo turns slowly and walks out into the hall. Ali turns back to his desk and continues 
working. Leo hesitates, then turns around.

LEO
Hey, kid...

Ali turns to look at Leo. The opening notes of "For What It's Worth" by Buffalo Springfield 
begin.

LEO
[softly] Way to be back at your desk.

They stare at each other for a few moments. Leo turns and leaves. Ali turns slowly back to 
his desk.

	There's something happening here 
	What it is ain't exactly clear
	There's a man with a gun over there 
	Telling me I got to beware 
	I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound 
	Everybody look what's going down.
	
	There's battle lines being drawn 
	Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
	Young people speaking their minds 
	Getting so much resistance from behind 
	I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
	Everybody look what's going down.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
