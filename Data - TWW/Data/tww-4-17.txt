FADE IN: INT. NEWPORT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

NEWSCASTER [on TV]
...with General Vahorean confirming, or I should say, disclosing, for the first time 
the names of the Marines taken hostage. They are Lance Corporals John Halley and Raymond 
Rowe and Private First Class Herman Hernandez. On what was described as a routine patrol 
of the perimeter of Bitanga airport, the three reported by radio an attacked by an 
estimated 50 members of the Kundu National Army.

	SATURDAY EVENING

We pan down from the TV to Toby who is talking into a cellphone. Charlie is standing at 
a window talking to a guard. They are finishing up paperwork to get out of jail.

TOBY
[into cellphone] Well, Sam's on his way over, and I'll tell you something, if I was 
someone who felt comfortable hugging other people, I'd give one to Sam 'cause he 
absolutely impaled himself. So I think the least I can do is bring the Ziegler brand 
of wisdom to the campaign for the last week, be a role model. By the way, you know 
what they don't tell you? You can post bond with a credit card.

CHARLIE
[to officer] Yo, man, that's totally whack!

TOBY 
[into cellphone] Yeah. Charlie's trying to throw down with the street. It's kind of a 
sad sight to see.

CHARLIE 
[to officer] I've got American Express. I've got Visa. I could've posted bond and gotten 
miles, damn it.

TOBY
[into cellphone] Hang on.

REPORTER [on TV]
...with White House Press Secretary, C.J. Cregg, telling us that President Bartlet, who 
was to spend the weekend in Southern California campaigning for Democratic Congressional 
candidate Sam Seaborn, has boarded Air Force One and is on his way back to Washington 
to more closely monitor the crisis-- I guess we'd have to call it-- with the three hostages.

OFFICER
[to Toby] Sir?

Toby walks over to the window where Charlie and the officer are.

TOBY
[into cellphone] Yeah. Uh, uh, when do you land?

OFFICER
[to Toby] Sign, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here. [flips the 
page] Initial it here, here, here, here, and sign again here.

TOBY
[into cellphone] Excuse me, I think they're making me buy somebody's house. Uh, call me 
when you land.

Toby hangs up the phone and walks over to a bench where several young ladies, scantily 
clad, are sitting.

TOBY
I'm sorry, I can't remember who I borrowed this from.

CALL GIRL
It was me.

TOBY
Thanks.

Sam enters.

SAM
Toby...

TOBY
I'm sorry I missed your rally. That was a hell of a thing you did with the tax plan.

SAM
Thank you.

TOBY
I meant it was really stupid.

SAM
Speaking of which, what happened?

TOBY
With us?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
At the bar?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
Couple of country club guys were a little lubed. They got into it with Andy. I wanted 
them to step back, and he slipped, and his wingman thought I hit him, so he came for me, 
and I took care of business.

CHARLIE
You did what?

TOBY
Charlie took care of business.

SAM
[to Charlie] You're all right?

CHARLIE
Yeah, I'm all right. You know, when you sit in a cage, you have time to do a lot of thinking.

TOBY
Hurricane, we were in the joint for two hours and 20 minutes, 'kay?

SAM
Look, you probably haven't had a chance to talk to anybody.

TOBY
No, I just got off with Josh, and I'm running the campaign for the last week.

SAM
Yeah. Technically, the President can't fire Scott Holcomb.

TOBY
He was taking it in the wrong direction, Sam, and you know it.

SAM
And you guys are going to take it in the right direction?

TOBY
We made a rough entrance here, but things are looking up now.

SAM
You trapped people at Disneyland, told the French they could stick a loaf of bread up 
their ass, had a meeting with a Communist, and things are looking up 'cause my new 
campaign director just made bail.

TOBY
Look, a glass is half full or half... You know, the other thing...

SAM
How'd you call Josh?

TOBY
What do you mean?

SAM
Didn't they take your cellphone from you?

TOBY
I borrowed theirs. [motions to the bench of call girls]

SAM
So on a call girl's phone bill, there's going to be a call to Air Force One?

TOBY
You're really going to be teaching the seminar on call girl caution? Really?

CHARLIE
Excuse me, but at this point, we're in jail voluntarily-- can we go?

SAM
What are we doing about this story?

TOBY
Nothing. It's a box on page 27.

SAM
Oh, I think it's going to be more than that.

TOBY
They got the hostages, the President heading to Washington, a flood in Colorado and a 
chemical fire in Providence. We got saved.

CUT TO: EXT. NEWPORT POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
They exit the police station where a horde of reporters are waiting.

REPORTERS
[clamoring] Mr. Ziegler! Mr. Seaborn! Mr. Young!

TOBY
All right, I called that putt too early.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

REPORTER [on TV]
Lance Corporal Halley is from Sarasota, Florida. He's 24 years old. He joined the Marine 
Corps. two years ago, and he did his basic training at Camp Pendleton. He is married with 
a three-year-old daughter. The three were deployed...

BARTLET
How come it's never people with six months to live who are taken hostage? I mean there's 
so much of it, you'd think once in a while we'd catch a break.

JOSH
[to Donna] Hey, Trotsky.

DONNA
Yeah.

INT. STAFF CABIN

JOSH
The First Lady's going to fly out to California tomorrow and do the President's public 
events. Would you let C.J. know that she should stay? She was going to take a red-eye back.

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Also, Charlie should stay and staff the First Lady.

DONNA
Okay, speaking of the First Lady, you have a meeting with Max in the morning.

JOSH
Yeah, Max is taken care of.

DONNA
All right, the HHS chapter of the submission is ready for you to proofread. You want me 
to do it?

JOSH
Well, I guess I'm really suppose to do it myself.

DONNA
Yes, but you don't do it yourself, so you want me to do it?

JOSH
You took a meeting with a Communist, Donna.

DONNA
Because you sent me there.

JOSH
Yeah. Fair enough. My bad.

DONNA
You want me to proofread this?

JOSH
Yes, please.

INT: MEETING ROOM

NANCY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah.

NANCY
Mr. McGarry.

BARTLET
Would you all excuse me?

The staffers get up and leave the office.

BARTLET
[into phone] Yeah?

We intercut between Bartlet in the meeting room and Leo and Fitz in the Situation Room.

LEO
Electronic eavesdropping and a couple of paid informants lead us to believe they're being 
held in a barracks about 37 miles east of Bitanga.

BARTLET
What happens if, screw the deadline, we just go to full deployment right now?

LEO
Well, I don't know, but the three Marines would certainly be executed.

BARTLET
All right, we got to go get them.

LEO
Fitz.

FITZWALLACE
The Delta Force, First Special Forces. That's 26 Special Ops. They've been practicing for 
the last three hours or so in Ghana. They're going to use the RH-66, the Comanche Attack-
Recon. When they've got it right in Ghana, that's when we'll recommend that you give the 
order, sir, and if that happens, we believe there's a 70 percent chance of success.

BARTLET
All right, then, on my order.

FITZWALLACE
Thank you, sir.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

CUT TO: INT. THE WEST WING - BASEMENT MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
Will is meeting with the writing staff interns.

WILL
You can't say their plan is the wrong way to stimulate the economy.

LAUREN CHIN
It is the wrong way.

WILL
No, it's not. It won't stimulate the economy at all. It'll stimulate yacht manufacturers. 
And don't say, "We believe." Make it declarative. 21 and 60.

He looks over and sees Lauren Shelby and Lauren Romano sleeping.

CASSIE
They've been working since very early this morning.

Will picks up a book, drops it on the desk in front of them. They jump.

LAUREN SHELBY
Right, yeah.

LAUREN ROMANO
Sure, yeah.

WILL
21, you wrote, "Even if it's true that capital gains rewards risk-taking, the plan is 
bad for the deficit." Why are you conceding their central point? And Lauren Shelby 
writes, "Rather then give the benefits to the rich, everyone one should get them in 
equal..." Our plan isn't equal. It raises taxes on the rich.

LAUREN ROMANO
I meant... metaphorically, I suppose.

WILL
Why don't I take this one.

CASSIE
Will, those are remarks for the Deputy Small Business Administrator.

WILL
So anyone sub-cabinet or lower-- it's okay to be a quivering mass of indecision?

CASSIE
I'm saying you have limited time and finite resources. Maybe it'd be best to triage.

Romano begins to doze off again.

WILL
Do not all asleep again.

LAUREN ROMANO
I thought I saw food on the floor.

CASSIE
They haven't eaten in a while.

WILL
There's food in the Mess.

CASSIE
The Mess closes at 6:00.

WILL
Is it after 6:00?

CASSIE
Yes.

WILL
What time is it?

CASSIE
11:30.

WILL
All right, you guys should go home.

CASSIE
You need anything?

WILL
No.

The girls get up and leave.

ELSIE
You didn't give them much encouragement?

WILL
What?

ELSIE
You didn't give them much encouragement.

WILL
I'm not their camp counselor. I need these things done by Monday. The staff quit. I'm 
not going to pretend these guys are speechwriters, and I'm going to figure out a way 
to do it myself.

ELSIE
By Monday morning?

WILL
Yes.

ELSIE
Okay, but you've had an attitude about the interns since yesterday.

WILL
I question their commitment.

ELSIE
Well, they're here on a Saturday night, and they don't get paid. You question their 
commitment?

WILL
"White House Intern" looks good on a resume. Three months from now, two of them will be 
working at Conde Nast and HBO.

The phone rings in the room.

ELSIE
And the other two?

WILL
WIll marry Senior Vice Presidents of Conde Nast and HBO. [into phone] Hello?

TOBY [VO]
Hey.

WILL
You guys all right?

TOBY [VO]
Charlie and I got arrested.

WILL
Yeah, I saw it on the news.

TOBY
It made the news out there?

WILL
A Jewish guy won a bar fight-- it's news everywhere.

TOBY
The President's coming out with his tax plan tomorrow, not Monday.

WILL
What are you talking about?

TOBY
Sam found out we were holding back 'cause of his campaign, and made the President flip 
the cards a couple of hours ago, so the toothpaste's out of the tube, and we're going 
to need to be ready with public remarks by the end of the day tomorrow.

Will snaps at Elsie to get her attention.

WILL
[to Elsie, whispering] Get 'em back.

ELSIE
Who?

WILL
The Ronettes. Get them back.

TOBY
Are you there?

WILL
Yeah. Uh, end of the day tomorrow.

TOBY
I'll call you in an hour.

CUT TO: INT. CALIFORNIA HOTEL-LOUNGE - NIGHT
Toby has just gotten off the phone with Will.

CHARLIE
Toby, I'm going to head to the airport and catch the red-eye back.

TOBY
No, actually you're not. The First Lady's flying in tomorrow and taking over the 
President's events, so she needs to be staffed.

CHARLIE
All right, how do I get her schedule?

TOBY
Advance is bringing it over to you.

CHARLIE
Did Zoey stay?

TOBY
Yeah, she's still here.

Charlie walks away. Toby sits down at a table where Amy and Sam are.

TOBY
All right, Amy, how much money does he have left?

AMY
$28,500 cash on hand. That's including a loan for $15,000 for targeted radio spots.

TOBY
Yet with regard to money you remain...?

AMY
Cautiously optimistic.

TOBY
Because?

AMY
The reason the campaign's strapped is that Scott Holcamb never tapped Democratic interest 
groups.

TOBY
Will they write checks this late?

AMY
If they can be convinced Sam's still sucking in some oxygen.

SAM
I'm enjoying this.

TOBY
You're eight points down with ten points up for grabs, and you need them all to break 
for you.

SAM
All of them?

TOBY
Yes. Well, look, it's been one of those days. Who would've thought Charlie could bust 
us out of the Newport Beach Correctional Facility using nothing but his shoes. Go ahead, 
tell them, Charlie.

They all look over at Charlie who is looking at a TV screen.

CHARLIE
These guys got beaten.

AMY
Is it possible that that happened in the struggle when they were ambushed?

TOBY
No.

CHARLIE
No. Theses guys got beaten.

They are all now looking at the TV which is showing a picture of three guys in military 
fatigue badly beaten.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

	SUNDAY MORNING

JOSH
I think 80 million... 

OMB AIDE 1
We're talking about PSSF grants?

JOSH
Yeah, I think 80 million is pretty unrealistic from the House. Didn't-- last year-- 
didn't the conferees split the differnce, like 68-something?

OMB AID 2
68.2, I think.

JOSH
All right, we'll tell them the budget submission's at 80, and everyone's happy at 70. 
Do we have anything else?

MAX
Can I just ask: Mrs. Bartlet was promised $12 million for immunization education funds at 
CDC, you've got the full 139 million for vaccines in here. Shouldn't they be earmarked 
seperately?

JOSH
Max, there's no more 12 million.

MAX
Why?

JOSH
I traded.

MAX
You're kidding me.

JOSH
I am not.

MAX
Josh, the First Lady wanted this. No one notified me this was on the table.

JOSH
You get a daily memo on Hill consultations.

MAX
I get 35 of them and you know it.

JOSH
Yes. Thank you.

Josh gets up and Max follows him into the HALLWAY.

MAX
I have to go tell this to the First Lady now.

JOSH
Well, I'd have someone else do it, but it's up to you.

CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT MEETING ROOM - DAY
Will is in the office alone when Cassie enters.

CASSIE
Good morning.

WILL
Good morning. Did you get some sleep?

CASSIE
God, yeah. That was a... nice four hours. I'm a whole new woman.

WILL
Are you the leader of the group?

CASSIE
I'm sorry?

WILL
Are you the group leader?

CASSIE
I've been here the longest.

WILL
You guys got to hunker down.

CASSIE
Will, I promise you, were doing our best.

WILL
I don't think you are.

CASSIE
Man, your sister was right.

WILL
Was she?

CASSIE
Yeah.

WILL
About what?

Elsie and the other three interns enter.

ELSIE
Good morning.

WILL
Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Elsie.

They all take a seat. Will stands in front of a markerboard which he has written on. 
This is what's on the board: 

	NW-U		PS Teacher		Doctor	
	$18,736	$41,724		$150,000	
	15%		28%			36%	
	$2811.90	$11,682		$54,000	
	0		0			$4,500	
	$321		$1,251		0	

As he speaks, he refers to this chart.

WILL
Minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. Times 40, times 52, that's $10,712 a year, which is what 
you make unloading boxes in a right-to-work state, say Kentucky. He can't live on that, 
so he puts in another 30 hours as a night watchman, bringing his total to $18,746 a year. 
He pays 15% in federal income tax or $2,811.90. Public school teacher. $41,724 is the 
national average. He's paying 28% or $11,682. And, finally, a doctor making 150,000 is 
paying 36% or $54,000 in taxes. 15%, 28%, 36%. It's called a progressice tax, it's been 
around since Lincoln. Under the plan the Republicans announced on Friday, the box unloader 
stays the same, the schoolteacher stays the same, the doctor gets $4,500 back. Under our 
plan, which has sort of been announced already, the box unloader gets $321 back, the 
schoolteacher gets $1,251, the doctor stays the same and to finance the tax deductability 
of college tuition for the chidren of the box unloader and the schoolteacher, we go to 
a fourth group, the uberwealthy, and ask a CEO making $16,400,000 a year to give us 
another one percent, taking him up to 41. Bring me whatever you have done in an hour. 
That's what I'm going to work with. Thanks.

ROMANO
The doctor got into medical school.

WILL
Hmm?

ROMANO
I'm sorry, I said the doctor got into medical school. He had to work hard to do that. 
And, presumably the CEO has some skills, the value of which the market has placed at 
$16,400,000.

WILL
Was there a spread on this in Republican Vogue? Bring me whatever you've got in an hour.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is sitting at his computer typing. He turns and gets a paper off of his desk. 
He looks up and sees Abbey leaning in the doorway.

JOSH
You're very stealthy, ma'am. I've always liked that about you.

ABBEY
Yeah?

JOSH
How are you this morning?

ABBEY
You outwitted my chancellor, you bested my swordsman.

JOSH
I haven mentioned this in a while, ma'am, but I think you and the President are a 
perfect couple.

ABBEY
I wanted that 12 million.

JOSH
Me, too, but at the end of a prize fight, you look at the guy who's dancing around, 
and that's who won.

ABBEY
Why doesn't my aganda get anywhere in these negotiations?

JOSH
Well, can I ask you, ma'am, why do you think?

ABBEY
Because you're a political snob who doesn't think the First Lady belongs on the starboard 
side of the building?

JOSH
Wrong.

ABBEY
Wrong what?

JOSH
Wrong, ma'am.

ABBEY
Damn right.

JOSH
The President and Leo make their decisions by listening to and participating in vigorous 
debate. This isn't school. I work with people who can play.

ABBEY
You're comfortable being this condescending with me?

JOSH
Yes, ma'am.

ABBEY
Why?

JOSH
Because I won-- I always do-- and you came here for my advice.

ABBEY
Max...

JOSH
Max is an idiot.

ABBEY
Max is my nephew.

JOSH
No kidding. He doesn't understand the budget process, he doesn't understand committee 
structure, he thinks decisions are made in meetings...

ABBEY
This is an extremely--

JOSH
...and he can't play at this level. Mrs. Bartlet, you're the First Lady, you need a Chief 
of Staff, a real one. If you want your agenda taken seriously, put a professional face on it.

ABBEY
Thank you.

JOSH
Thank you, ma'am.

She gets up, and Josh watches her as she walks down the hallway.

CUT TO: EXT. CALIFORNIA, NEWPORT BEACH - DAY
Toby and Sam are walking along the beach.

TOBY
When they ask you why you're here today, you say, "Orange County's beachfront is national 
treasure."

SAM
Who are you, Charlie McCarthy?

TOBY
Charlie McCarthy was the dummy. Edgar Bergen was the ventriloquist. When they ask you 
about the rise in the Consumer Price Index, you say, "Orange County's beachfront is a 
national treasure."

SAM
They're going to ask me about the Democratic tax plan.

TOBY
They might.

SAM
They might?

TOBY
They will.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
And when they do, here's what you say: "Orange County's beachfront is a national treasure."

SAM
Assuming I did say that, which there's no chance I'm going to, you don't think I'd sound 
like an idiot?

TOBY
I doubt you'll sound like anything. They'll just use it b-roll. But on the off-chance 
there's audio, you might as well be on message.

They have now reached a group of reporters that have assembled to interview Sam on 
the beach.

TOBY
[to reporters] Sam will take some questions now.

REPORTER
Mr. Seaborn, what are we doing here today?

Sam looks over to Toby who smiles.

SAM
Well, Orange County's beachfront are a national treasure, Samantha. And that's why I 
support creating the Federal Beach Project...

Sam continues with the interview. C.J. walks over to Toby.

C.J.
He looks youthful.

TOBY
Yes.

C.J.
And energetic.

TOBY
Yes.

C.J.
He looks youthful and energetic. Do we have anything he can jump over?

TOBY
What do you want?

C.J.
What's going on at the White House?

TOBY
I'm standing right here, I don't have special powers of... When you brief the press, 
that's when I'll know.

C.J.
You've never been on a beach in your life, have you?

TOBY
No.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

BARTLET
They're here?

DEBBIE
Ye-yes, sir. Um...

BARTLET
Who are they?

DEBBIE
Diane Halley and her... their three-year-old; Esteban and Louisa Hernandez; and Martha Rowe.

BARTLET
Is the three-year-old in there?

DEBBIE
Yeah. I-I'll take care of it.

BARTLET
This is my first time doing this particular one.

Bartlet enters THE MURAL ROOM where the families of the soldiers taken hostage are sitting.

BARTLET
Good morning, I'm Jed Bartlet. Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez?

They shake hands.

ESTEBAN "STEVE" HERNANDEZ
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Mrs. Rowe?

They shake hands.

MARTHA ROWE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Mrs. Halley, is it all right if I call you Diane?

They shake hands.

DIANE HALLEY
Diane's fine.

BARTLET
Are you Betty?

BETTY HALLEY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Are you three years old?

BETTY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Are you scared now?

She looks down and doesn't responds.

BARTLET
Don't be. Diane, do you mind if Betty sat in the next room with my secretary, Ms. Fiderer?

DEBBIE
We'll be just on the other side of that door.

DIANE
[to Betty] Yeah, honey, wait for me in the room next door with...

DEBBIE
Debbie. Come on, Betty. I know a lot about you.

Ms. Fiderer takes Betty by the hand and escorts her out of the room.

BARTLET
[to guards] Thank you. [to families] Please. Mm-hmm.

They sit down.

MARTHA
No one can tell us anything. The picture is real?

BARTLET
Yeah. It was taken off of Kundunese TV.

MARTHA
Ah. They have TV?

BARTLET
Yeah, sure.

There is a large moment of ackward silence.

ESTEBAN
They, um... They've been beaten, hmm?

BARTLET
I'm afraid so, sir, yes. We're currently negotiating for Red Cross access so they can 
get medical attention.

DIANE
Where are they being held? What kind of place is it?

BARTLET
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.

DIANE
Do you know? I mean, do you know where they're...

BARTLET
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that either.

ESTEBAN
But something is being done to get the boys back?

BARTLET
Mr. Hernandez, I can only imagine...

MARTHA
You can't tell us that either?

BARTLET
No, ma'am, I can't.

There's a knock at the door and Leo enters.

LEO
Excuse me.

BARTLET
Excuse me, please.

Bartlet and Leo walk out to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE and close the door.

LEO
Delta just got it right in Ghana.

BARTLET
Let's go.

CUT TO: INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Fitzwallace is briefing Bartlet and Leo on the rescue scenario.

FITZWALLACE
They fly in on two Comanches and a Blackhawk. 20 men forcibly secure the perimeter of 
the barracks. A snatch force of 6 men penetrate and take the captives.

LEO
What about resistance?

FITZWALLACE
Well, they're going to subdue sentries and visible guards; they've got heavy sniper 
rifles and the CIA wet team.

LEO
What's the timetable?

FITZWALLACE
47 minutes to get there from the President's go order. That's radio silence. Two hours 
to get it done.

BARTLET
Why a wet team?

FITZWALLACE
Excuse me, sir?

BARTLET
Why the CIA wet team? We're not near water.

FITZWALLACE
No, sir, it's called... They call it a wet team because it's bloody.

BARTLET
I had to ask. What's it called?

FITZWALLACE
Task Force Dawn Sky.

Bartlet mulls over giving the order.

BARTLET
Go.

FITZWALLACE
Go.

Bartlet stands in silence as the officers around him busily get to work.

OFFICER 1
It's a go. Task Force is go...

OFFICER 2
Dawn Sky's in operation.

OFFICER 3
Stand by.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
The place is moving with a little bit more than the usual bussle. Elsie finds Will in 
the crowd and walks over to him with a pile of papers.

ELSIE
Work at the end of hour seven.

WILL
Where's everyone else?

ELSIE
They asked me to bring it.

WILL
They're scared of me?

ELSIE
Yes

WILL
Give me that.

He takes them and they start walking into WILL'S OFFICE.

WILL
[as he looks over the papers] What did Cassie mean when she said "Your sister was right 
about you?"

ELSIE
What'd you mean?

WILL
She said, "Man, your sister was right about you."

ELSIE
I probably was...

WILL
About what?

ELSIE
What'd you mean?

WILL
Will you shut up and tell me what you said?

ELSIE
Clock's ticking...

Will starts reading from the papers.

WILL
"In our redistributive tax plan.." I don't want them calling it that. It sounds a lot 
like redistributing wealth, which, in human history, has normally been preceeded by heads 
on the pitchforks of peasants. "In the Bartlet plan, Americans making less than $40,000 
a year would see their marginal tax rate cut from 15% and 28% respectively, to 12% and 
23%." I'm sleeping already.

ELSIE
Hardass.

WILL
What?

ELSIE
Cassie said, "So, what's the deal with your step brother?" And I said, "He's a very sweet 
hardass."

WILL
You did?

ELSIE
Yeah.

They walk back out of the office to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

WILL
And she said, "Your sister was right about you."

ELSIE
She probably meant that you were sweet.

WILL
Nah, I don't think she did. 

ELSIE
How do you know?

WILL
Because.

ELSIE
Willy..

Will throws his head back violently in disgust.

WILL
Don't call me that!

He turns and heads back for WILL'S OFFICE and Elsie follows. She's finally been driven 
to the edge.

ELSIE
Sputnik crashed down on your head overnight. You were concentrating on one speech, 
and suddenly you're deputy director, and the director's a continent away, and the 
speechwriting staff quit!

WILL
Because of me.

ELSIE
Because they're idiots! And the tax plan's out two days early, and you weren't here for 
the nine months before, so you're cramming it. And you're taking it all out on four 
defenseless interns who, by the way, think Sputnik's crashed down on their heads too!

WILL
[beat, indicating the papers] Leave these. I'll make notes.

ELSIE
[reluctantly] Okay.

She turns away and exits. Will looks over at the broken plexiglass between his and Toby's 
office. He walks over and lightly puts his hand on it. The plexiglass falls into Toby's 
office and shatters. Will looks shocked, then calmly acknowleges the accident and walks 
away as we...

CUT TO: EXT. CALIFORNIA HOTEL - DAY

	SUNDAY AFTERNOON

We hear people clapping.

CUT TO: INT. SMALL BANQUET ROOM - DAY
Abbey is at a podium with tables on either side. There are two large banners saying 
"The DNC honors the Bartlet women." About 4 women are seated on either side at the tables. 
The one we recognize is Amy, seated on the far end to Abbey'S left. There are about 75 
people seated at tables in the audience.

ABBEY
"The DNC honors the Bartlet women." Well, I assume you're talking about my daughters and 
my mother-in-law, beacuse if the DNC's honoring my husband's skanky ex-girlfriends... 

Everyone laughs. 

ABBEY
No. You're honoring the great work done by so many women during Jed's first term. Sherri 
Klein and Jean Hammond at the NWLA who got $20 billion into the federal budget for health 
care coverage for the uninsured and children of low-income parents. 

Everyone claps.

ABBEY
Ellen Misegen and her team at the National Education initiative.

Everyone claps. We focus on Amy, who knocks a candle down onto the table. She quickly 
picks it back up, but then realizes her napkin's on fire, as Abbey keeps speaking.

ABBEY
Rachel Warren and the Child Care tax incenitve program...

Everyone claps again. Amy tries to beat the napkin on the table to put out the fire, 
but that just makes it stronger. She dumps her water on it, as Abbey keeps speaking.

ABBEY
Elizabeth Lowell and the Women's Health Coalition.

Everyone starts clapping. The fire has gone crazy now, and Amy finally gets aggressive, 
knocking something glass to the floor and really starts hitting the flame with her napkin. 
Though she's successful at putting it out, everyone, including Abbey, notices.

AMY
[to Abbey] I beg your pardon, Ma'am.

ABBEY
And Amy Gardner, who's had seven jobs in three years.

Everyone chuckles a bit and claps. Amy gives them an embarrassed wave.

ABBEY
On behalf of the DNC, on behalf of the White House, on behalf of the President, I thank 
you very much. And let's send Sam Seabourn to Congress! Thank you!

Everyone is on their feet and clapping. Abbey exits out a side door and motions for Amy 
to follow her as we...

CUT TO: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Abbey and Amy are walking out of the room and into the courtyard to visit with people. 

AMY
I'm so sorry, Ma'am, I was reaching for the water glass, misjudged the angle on the candle 
and, as you saw, one thing led to another.

ABBEY
How did you live with Josh Lyman?

AMY
I'm sorry?

ABBEY
How did you live with him? He beat Max out of the 12 million earmarked for vaccine education 
and when I said I wanted the 12 million, he said, "So did I. And at the end of the prizefight, 
you look at the guy who's dancing around and that's who won." So I wanna know, how did you 
live with him?

They've stepped out to a group of people. They all clap and Abbey waves.

AMY
We never technically lived together, which was the subject of many...

ABBEY
Don't you wanna kill him when he says things like that?

AMY
My problem is I wanna jump him when he says things like that.

ABBEY
Where'd you get your mouth?

AMY
Brown and then Yale Law School.

ABBEY
Hmm.

A woman, ALANA MOIRON, waves to Abbey and starts to walk over. Abbey notices.

ABBEY
Oh God. Alana Moiron is about to zatz me on fair pay. Save me, would you?

AMY
You want me to?

ABBEY
Please.

Alana has made it over. Abbey fakes being happy to see her. They shake hands.

ALANA
Abbey, you were charming.

ABBEY
It's good to see you, Alana.

ALANA
I'm not sure if you saw my op/ed this morning..

ABBEY
I did.

AMY
[piping in] Me too.

Alana tries to ignore Amy.

ALANA
Well, what I wanted to say was...

AMY
I thought it was teriffic, if that counts for anything.

ALANA
Thank you. [to Abbey] Obviously...

AMY
And courageous.

ALANA
I'm sorry?

AMY
I say, I thought it was courageous. Because the leadership wanted fair pay done quietly, 
so it didn't become necessary for the moderate Republicans to make it a symbol of left-
wing overreaching. Not like the President doesn't have enough problems, but you said, 
"Screw the leadership." And I think that's courageous. Ironically, I have a hunch that 
the first lady could have been brought on board fair pay if she had been lobbied more, 
what's the word, more, you know, professionally. Rather than being embarrased in this 
morning's newspaper, Alana.

Amy has a sly smile. Alana tries to hide her embarrassment.

ALANA [to Abbey]
Lovely remarks today, Ma'am. That's all I came over to say.

ABBEY
Thank you.

Alana leaves. Abbey turns to Amy with a look that says "What the *@!& was that?"

AMY
You said, "Save me."

ABBEY
I meant, walk me to the other side of the room or something.

AMY
Oh. Oh, sorry.

Abbey looks at Amy with a smile, as if she just had an epiphany.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY
Mrs. Rowe is holding a picture of her son. We pan up to reveal Leo now in the President's 
place, surrounded by more than the usual security. Ms. Halley and the Hernandez couple 
are still here too.

ROWE
So this is what it looks like from where you are, Mr. McGarry?

LEO
I'm sorry?

ROWE
I said, this is what it looks like from where you are.

LEO
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rowe, I still don't follow...

ROWE
The comfortable chairs and the body guards.

LEO
I'm sorry, I'm still not... I can tell you if it's just a matter of.. [nods at the 
body guards] When the U.S. is involved in a military conflict anywhere in the world, 
the chief of staff is given increased security. It's just.. is that what you meant?

ROWE
I meant that the Bartlet people aren't ones for joining the service. Did you serve?

LEO
I did. I flew F-105's for the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing.

ROWE
During a war?

LEO
Yeah. The war in Vietnam.

ROWE
I apologize, sir. My mistake.

LEO
That's alright.

We now notice that Mr. Hernandez has been pacing behind Leo this whole time. 

MR. HERNANDEZ
Mr. McGarry?

Leo stands up and walks over to him.

LEO
You should call me Leo.

MR. HERNANDEZ
Stephan. Steve. Does my son.. would these boys know anything... have any information...

LEO
Steve, you wanna ask me if your son's being tortured.

MR. HERNANDEZ
[trying desperately to get through the question] Would they know any information?

LEO
I can't tell you that.

There's a knock on the door. Leo's guards open it.

LEO
Excuse me.

Leo steps out into the hall where Margaret is waiting for him.

MARGARET
Coming up on 47 minutes plus 2 hours.

LEO
Well, let's get everybody in.

Margaret nods her head and leaves. Leo leaves too, and we see the guards close the doors 
to the room.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Donna is walking through with a stack of papers. She finds Josh at her desk.

	SUNDAY EVENING

DONNA
You got a fax from Amy.

JOSH
What does she say?

DONNA
Looks like it's just some campaign updates.

JOSH
Read it to me.

DONNA
"Low-dollar program capped at 37K, three new national endorsements including Sierra Club 
and NARAL, latter on promise of opposition to partial birth ban. Mrs. B says..."

All of the sudden a female aide comes rushing up to Josh.

MADDI TATEM
Hey Josh? Did you sign of on 30 million from the immunization fund to be ear marked for 
immunization education?

JOSH
Yep.

MADDI
Really?

JOSH
Yep.

MADDI
I thought you settled that with the First Lady's office.

JOSH
Yeah. Wait, what?

MADDI
Hi, how you doing? Maddi Tatem, we've worked together for two years.

JOSH
Did you say immunization education?

MADDI
Yeah, vaccines in the HHS budget. [referencing her paper] You moved 40 million from 
nutrition services in the...

JOSH
I didn't move anything.

MADDI
It's in the HHS final.

JOSH
Let me see this.

He takes the paper, and looks at it for a second.

JOSH
This isn't what we had this morning.

MADDI
They said the changes were made in the galleys. Didn't you proofread it?

JOSH
[to Donna] I don't know. Did I proofread it?

DONNA
Yeah, but you proofread it to make sure "capital" was spelled with an "a" and not an "o", 
you didn't proofread it to..

JOSH
..to make sure it reflected the changes we agreed to? I didn't do that.

DONNA
Not as such. No.

JOSH
[to Maddi] Who moved the money?

MADDI
I don't know.

JOSH
Whoever moved the money knows that I don't proofread these things.

MADDI
Well, then, it must have been Max.

JOSH
Max doesn't know anything.

MADDI
Then I give up.

JOSH
[sarcastically] Boy, really leaving no stone unturned, aren't ya?

DONNA
Don't yell at her.

JOSH
[to Donna] Read me the rest of the fax.

DONNA
What?

JOSH
How did she... Read me the fax. 

DONNA
"...latter on promise of opposition to partial birth ban. Mrs. B says you're encouraging 
her to hire a new chief of staff, need Treasury breakdown of cap. gains cut, First Lady 
took your advice; she just hired me."

Josh is clearly surprised by this.

DONNA
[beat] "Weather is 74 degrees and partly cloudy." [chuckles] Well, a whole new chapter 
begins.

Josh looks at her for a second before finally finding words.

JOSH
Yeah.

Josh walks very slowly into his office. He's still trying to absorb this news.

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL ROOM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - NIGHT
C.J. is looking out the window in a gown. Toby walks in and sits on the couch. He's 
wearing a tux.

TOBY
You know, I think I've got..yes, yes I do, I've still got sand in my shoes from like six 
hours ago.

C.J.
[singing] Sand in my shoes...

While she's been singing, Toby has taken off one of his shoes. Toby bangs it on a coffee 
table several times very loudly. 

C.J.
[still singing] ..sand from Havana...

Toby pours sand out of his shoe. Quite a bit, actually. 

TOBY
You know, I'm looking at this wire report. Why's the First Lady commenting on falling 
soybean prices?

C.J. 
[sits on the table] That's what they were asking her?

TOBY
Why'd you let her take the questions?

C.J.
In retrospect, that's what a lot of us are wondering. 

Charlie walks in, also in tux, and talks to C.J.

CHARLIE
Mrs. Bartlet would like you to know that at the D Triple C tonight, she wants to change 
her remarks and talk about the House vote on the nutrition assistance program.

C.J.
I don't think that's a good idea.

TOBY
Why not?

C.J.
[while putting on coat] 'Cause it's a black tie event. And when she talks about poor 
women wearing a $4000 Mercritia dress, she looks like Marie Antoinette.

TOBY
She's right.

C.J.
I am. So, you should tell her that, Charlie.

CHARLIE 
I'm sorry?

C.J.
You should tell her not to talk about the House vote.

CHARLIE
You want me to tell Mrs. Bartlet she's gonna look like a dilettante?

C.J.
I once had to tell the President he was wearing two different shoes.

CHARLIE
That's roughly the same.

Charlie leaves. Sam comes in from the other side of a door plastered with a "Seaborn for 
Congress" poster.

SAM
[to Toby] You polished up my remarks?

TOBY
Those are recommendations.

SAM
For the office park?

TOBY
They're recommendations. Say what you want.

SAM
I'm asking, do you mean for the office park now or the banquet tonight?

TOBY
I meant for both.

SAM
[looking at the paper] "Charles Darwin-omics" for the Chamber of Commerce. "Trickle-down 
travesties.."

C.J.
That was mine.

Charlie walks back in hurriedly.

CHARLIE
She's ready to go.

C.J.
Good luck. We'll catch up with you later.

Charlie and C.J. both leave.

SAM
[to Toby] They're well-paid technology workers. What happened to courting undecideds?

TOBY
[as he fixes his cuffs] That's what we're doing.

SAM
Darwin-omics at the Chamber of Commerce tonight? That's flamethrower language.

TOBY
You don't wanna be a flamethrower?

SAM
I didn't say that.

TOBY
[standing] Good. You feel alright?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY 
[putting on his coat] Then let's go.

Toby leaves. Sam looks at him for a second, then gets up to go.

CUT TO: INT. SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
The camera pans down to reveal everybody at work. Bartlet is seated at the far end 
looking very anxious.

BARTLET
At what point do we start to worry?

FITZWALLACE
I'm sorry?

BARTLET
Hack was 2 hours and 47 minutes.

FITZWALLACE
That was an approximation.

BARTLET
Yeah, but it's four hours and ten minutes now. I've got three parents, a wife and a 
three-year-old up there. At what point do I tell them what's going on?

FITZWALLACE
Let's give 'em some time.

LEO
How much time before we send some guys in to get the guys we sent in to get the guys..

Leo is interrupted by voices over the radio.

VOICE 1 [OS]
Dakota-1-1-ODS. Is this channel secured?

VOICE 2 [OS]
Confirmed. Dakota-1-1. Call in. Over.

VOICE 3 [OS]
Zeus-4-1.

VOICE 4 [OS]
Black Widow-1-1-ODS.

FITZWALLACE
That's all three choppers. [to radio] U-COM, can you confirm the cargo?

VOICE 2 [OS]
Dakota-1-1, say if cargo's on board.

VOICE 1 [OS]
U-COM, Dakota-1-1 has confirmed.At this, everyone in the room celebrates and claps.

BARTLET
[to Fitzwallace] Ask him to confirm it again.

FITZWALLACE
Confirm again, U-COM!

VOICE 2 [OS]
Dakota-1-1, confirm your cargo.

VOICE 1 [OS]
Lance Corporals Halley and Rowe and PFC Hernandez..

We can't hear VOICE 1 anymore because everybody in the room erupts with satisfaction.

LEO
I gotta tell you something, that was the longest radio silence since Mexico.

We see an aide carry in a note as everyone else keeps talking. The note goes to Fitzwallace.

FITZWALLACE
Leo?

Leo now sees the note.

BARTLET
What's that?

FITZWALLACE
Red Haven's on fire.

BARTLET
What does that mean?

LEO
A bomb went off.

FITZWALLACE
[to radio] U-COM, are you reading a condition on Red Haven?

VOICE 2 [OS]
Roger that, Red Haven's on fire.

FITZWALLACE
Can you give me a situation assessment?

BARTLET
What's Red Haven?

LEO
It's the base in Ghana where the Deltas practiced.

BARTLET
Fitz, what's going on?

FITZWALLACE
It's coming.

VOICE 2 [OS]
White House, U-COM. Best as we can tell, three SUVs breached the gate at Haven. First one 
was stopped and the other two continued before driving into a barracks and exploding their C4s.

FITZWALLACE
[beat] Casualties?

BARTLET
It was a suicide bombing.

VOICE 2 [OS]
They're reporting 17 dead and some 20 insured. 

BARTLET
[to Fitzwallace] I want Threat Con Charlie for Africa and Europe.

FITZWALLACE
Okay.

VOICE 2 keeps going in the background as Fitzwallace sets everything into motion.

BARTLET
[to Leo] Why don't you go talk to the families?

LEO
Yes sir. I'll be right back.

CUT TO: INT. MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
Mrs. Halley, Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez and Mrs. Rowe are still inside with Debbie.

HALLEY
They've been gone a long time now.

DEBBIE
As soon as they know anything, I'm sure they'll send someone here.

HALLEY
Well, that's not true, though. I mean, they know a lot, but they can't tell us.

DEBBIE
That's for everyone's safety.

ROWE
Can you tell us this? Why were these boys sent to a place I've never heard of? And to 
kill people I've never heard of?

DEBBIE
That's a complicated question.

ROWE
I'm a smart lady.

Debbie just stares at her, as there's a knock at the door. The guards open it and Leo's there.

MR. HERNANDEZ
Leo?

LEO
They're safe. They're in air space over Morocco.

Obviously, the family members act very relieved. Mrs. Halley hugs her daughter. 

HALLEY
[sobbingly] Thank you.

MR. HERNANDEZ 
What happened?

LEO
Our special ops forces staged a successful rescue. They'll be brought to a hospital at 
Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany and they'll be home tomorrow. We'll have communications 
set up in a few minutes You can speak with them. The President wishes he could be here 
himself to tell you, but he's engaged at the moment.

ROWE
Leo, what aren't you telling us?

LEO 
The boys are fine, Mrs. Rowe. 

ROWE
But something has happened.

LEO
It appears there has been a terrorist retaliation at the makeshift camp we set up in Ghana 
to practice for the rescue. 17 staff and administrators were killed.

The room is somber again.

LEO
Someone will be in to take care of you. Thank you.

At this, Leo and Debbie leave the room, and the guards close the doors again.

CUT TO: INT. OEOB MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
The interns and Elsie are here, working hard. Will walks in with a piece of paper. Elsie 
stands behind him smiling, as if she knows exactly what he's about to do.

WILL
Listen to this. "Our taxes aren't a penalty, as hard as that is to believe. They are 
the price we pay for our roads and bridges. And they're the way we look after the least 
among us. The sign and signal of our obligations to each other and to our own best selves."

LAUREN CHIN
That's nice. Did you write that?

WILL
No. You did.

LAUREN CHIN
I didn't write that.

WILL
You did. I painted it, but it's yours. [points at Lauren Shelby] You wrote, "We must rise 
above parochial interests and speak to the national interest. Instead of a trickle-down 
economy, imagine one where the work and welfare of ordinary Americans is placed at the 
center of national life."

LAUREN SHELBY
I wrote that?

WILL
You did?

LAUREN SHELBY 
I'm very good.

WILL
Don't get carried away. Which one of you is Shelby and which is Romano?

LAUREN ROMANO
[smiling] I'm Romano. 

WILL
[apologetically] "A spread in the Republican Vogue?" What was that supposed to be, clever?

LAUREN ROMANO 
You're entitled.

WILL
A guy's entitled to shout stupid things at a ballpark. Doesn't make me want to follow his 
lead, you know? The answer to your question about why the MD should accept a greater tax 
burden in spite of the fact that his success is well earned is called the veil of ignorance. 
Imagine before you're born you don't know anything about who you'll be, your abilities, 
or your position. Now design a tax system.

LAUREN ROMANO 
Veil of ignorance?

WILL
John Rawls. We rescued the hostages, but suicide bombers killed 17 US soldiers in Ghana. 
This'll be what we're talking about tomorrow, so I'm gonna put the tax plan aside and work 
on this. You all did well. I'll see you tomorrow.

Will walks out, but the interns spring into action.

LAUREN ROMANO 
Lauren, why don't we get the profiles?

LAUREN SHELBY 
...We're gonna need a minute-by-minute...

CASSIE
Can we get a bible?

They all keep talking, as Will looks back through the door and re-enters. 

WILL
Elsie? [She walks up to him.] I don't think they understood. They can go home.

ELSIE
They understood. 

They both smile. Elsie walks back to the table, Will walks out.

CUT TO: INT. A BAR IN ORANGE COUNTY - NIGHT
Sam comes in, wearing a white-tie suit.

SAM
We are preaching to the choir and that is all we're doing. We packed the whole damn 
office park with -- Where the hell did he go?

BARTENDER
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

SAM
No. No, no. Are you open?

BARTENDER
We have a private party here in a little while.

SAM
I'm supposed to be next door.

Toby comes in, also in a white-tie suit.

TOBY
Hey. Sorry. I didn't catch that last part, you were walking a little fast. 

SAM
You packed the office park with bodies from Labor! AFL, teamsters, it was like the cast 
of a James Cagney movie. The reason for the event was to talk to wired workers.

TOBY
I didn't want a half-empty rally, and the wired workers are wired to Webb.

Toby sits at the bar.

SAM
We spent through the day in one-on-ones with Planned Parenthood, Families America, AARP. 
You think any of those people are gonna vote for Webb on Election Day?

TOBY
Your concern is that those people are gonna stay home and do laundry on Election Day.

SAM
And now I'm supposed to go into Chamber of Commerce and do a chorus and two verses of 
"Titans of Corporate Greed"?

TOBY
Problem?

SAM
It's the Chamber of Commerce. The titans are the ones in the room.

TOBY
[to the bartender] Can we get a couple of shots and a glass of beer?

Sam finally sits beside Toby.

SAM
We're preaching to the choir.

TOBY
I'm sorry?

SAM
I'm saying you had me preaching to the choir.

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
Why?

TOBY
'Cause that's how you get 'em to sing.

SAM
I can just cut any chance I have for victory. The story'll be "It's over."

TOBY
No. The story's going to be that you actually stuck up for what you believed in, you 
didn't cut and run. And people are gonna remember that, I'm gonna make sure of it.

SAM
I'm gonna lose.

Toby looks up at him as if to say "You just now figured this out?"

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
There's no chance of a miracle?

TOBY
No.

SAM
Then why are you here?

TOBY
You're gonna lose, and you're gonna lose huge. They're gonna throw rocks at you next week, 
and I wanted to be standing next to you when they did.

SAM
[sarcastically] Oh, really?

TOBY
Yeah.

Sam is touched.

SAM
[seriously now] Really?

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
Okay.

Sam smiles down at his drink. Toby pats him on the back, and they hug.

SAM
I'm just getting creamed. I'm just getting worked.

TOBY
You're not imagining it. 

They break the hug.

SAM
Thanks.

BARTENDER
I don't know if you heard, it was just on the news. Some terrorist bombing in Africa 
at an Army base.

Sam and Toby nod somberly.

SAM
Yeah. We heard. [to Toby] We should get back to work.

TOBY
God Bless the President of the United States and Sam Seaborn.

They clink their glasses and down their drinks.

TOBY
Let's go.

They get up. Toby leaves a tip, and they walk out.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
