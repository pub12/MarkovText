TEASER

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Margaret knocks and enters. Two men are seated, talking to Leo.

BILL
Most of us are just hearing the news now.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
From a conference call.

LEO
Yes.

BILL
There hasn't been a lot of time to digest this.

WADE
...But what we do know is that it's the House Democrats that are going to take it in 
the throat.

LEO
Yeah.

WADE
You might be able to get the voters to accept M.S. in some suburban districts, but 
the whole House is up for reelection.

LEO
Yeah.

BILL
It's not a matter of accepting M... There was a cover... 

WADE
The point is, even if you could squeeze out an electoral...

BILL
Even if you can squeeze out a win, this is what the campaign is going to be about.

WADE
You're going to have Democrats telling the President, "Don't come to my district; I've 
got troubles enough," and your campaign never gets out of the Rose Garden.

BILL
Yes, and we're running without a standard bearer. At a time when we've got policy cases 
against the Republicans on tax cuts, environment, education... and *this* is what the 
campaign's going to be about.

WADE
Now, Leo, most of us are just hearing the news. And I don't like to be the first one to 
say it, but I'm gonna. I think the President has got to strongly consider not running 
for reelection.

LEO
[beat] You think you're the first one to say it?

WADE
Leo...

LEO
You are, at minimum, the 35th in the last two hours.

WADE
Well, we're the ones that are talking to you now. And we're the ones that are asking. 
Is the President going to run for reelection?

LEO
Harry, Bill, there's going to be a press conference tonight. I'd watch.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY
Toby is speaking to a couple of guys about the room they're in.

TOBY 
He'll sit here, with the First Lady on his right.

LARRY 
You don't want him in front of the fireplace?

TOBY 
The fireplace is too much. He'll sit here, which means they're gonna have to light the 
room from the outside the window. Do they know that?

LARRY 
We'll let them know.

TOBY
The last time they didn't know. The President taped an Easter message that looked like 
it was lit by Ed Wood!

Toby exits to the HALLWAY, then to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Sam walks up.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY 
A pitcher of water, but keep it off-screen.

SAM 
Do they know?

TOBY 
They gotta light from outside the window, if they don't light from outside the window...

SAM 
I don't care. Look, Toby, has anyone considered whether or not he's up for this?

TOBY 
Up for this?

SAM 
I mean, some stuff has happened since...

TOBY 
C.J. gave it to the network. We're pretty much locked in, so...

SAM 
When are we prepping with him?

TOBY 
After the service.

SAM 
There's gonna be time?

TOBY 
We'll have the afternoon.

SAM 
I think we should consider taking...

TOBY 
[walking away] There aren't any options left. We're going on T.V., at eight.

GINGER
[walking up] Toby...

TOBY 
Yeah.

GINGER 
I'm sorry, but I had to put Greg Summerhays back on your schedule.

TOBY 
No, I took him off.

GINGER 
Leo's office had me put him back on.

TOBY 
Why?

GINGER 
They wanted you to keep the appointment.

TOBY 
[stopping] We've got her funeral today. We've got these...

GINGER 
I said four o'clock.

TOBY 
[pats Ginger's arm then walks] Yeah, all right.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'s OFFICE - DAY
C.J. enters and walks to Carol's desk.

C.J. 
Carol.

CAROL 
Yeah.

C.J. 
[handing her a folder] AP, Reuters, Agence France, something about seating on 
Air Force One...

CAROL 
Seating arrangements?

C.J. 
[nodding] Seating arrangements on Air Force One.

C.J. walks into her office, and Josh enters.

JOSH 
C.J.?

C.J. 
Listen, I was thinking since it's probably going to be a light day, I'd maybe blow off 
work, go shopping or something. What do you need?

JOSH 
Can I give you a quick brief?

C.J. 
Sure.

JOSH 
The Justice Department's run out of money in their suit against the tobacco companies. 

C.J. 
The Justice Department's overmatched.

JOSH 
Yeah, by hundreds of millions of dollars. They're asking for $30 million and we think 
they should have it.

C.J. 
Who disagrees with us?

JOSH 
Eight of the fifteen members of the subcommittee that controls the budgets for Justice 
and Commerce, including Kalmbach, who has significant ties to tobacco, and Warren and 
Rossitter, who do not.

C.J. 
We lost two Democrats?

JOSH 
They have ideological objections.

C.J. 
Yeah, it's just not a good time to be losing Democrats.

JOSH 
You haven't been in my office this morning.

C.J. 
We'll get them back.

They walk-and-talk down the HALLWAY.

JOSH 
Anyway, uh, Leo felt pretty strongly that we should light a fire under it, so I wrote 
up a pretty strongly worded release.

C.J. 
[skimming] 'The White House, for immediate release, Office of the Press. Today the 
President calls on Congress... deserve their day in court, and this administration won't 
sit on the bench while well-fed members of the Appropriations Committee choke off funding 
for a lawsuit aimed at perpetrators of hundreds of thousands of negligent homicides while 
filling their campaign war chests.' [looks up at Josh in amazement] This is like the fire 
we used to throw in the early primaries.

JOSH 
[smiling] Let Bartlet be Bartlet.

C.J. 
You got to put it away for a while.

JOSH 
You think?

C.J. 
I'm going in there now to tell them a landing ship helicopter assault team is steaming 
off Port-au-Prince and after that I'm bringing in AP, Reuters, and Agence France. 
Nobody's gonna write about an Appropriations Bill. Haiti's gonna get bumped to the 
Lifestyle section.

JOSH 
Yeah, I suppose. 

C.J. starts to walk away.

JOSH
Listen... Have you seen him today?

C.J. 
[turning back] No. Have you?

JOSH 
No.

C.J. 
All right. Listen, I've gotta...

JOSH 
Yeah. Thanks.

C.J. turns and leaves.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Sam is meeting with Democratic Party strategists.

HANSON 
Why are we assuming it's Hoynes?

PHILLIPS 
Please...

HANSON 
No, why are we assuming it's gotta be Hoynes? You don't think Wetland's gonna get in 
on it? Hutchinson? Seth Gillette?

PHILLIPS 
Please...

MAN 
Gillette's lucky if he carries his immediate family.

ANOTHER MAN 
[in a condescending tone] It's Hoynes.

PHILLIPS 
It's Hoynes. Sam, you understand this conversation isn't ruling out Bartlet as a 
candidate, it's just a 'what if?' We're party strategists, it's what we're paid for.

SAM 
Yeah.

MAN 
Hoynes is the only one that put together the money this fast.

PHILLIPS 
He's the most successful fundraiser the party's ever had.

MAN 
Though, obviously, it would be easier if Hoynes was running as an incumbent...

SAM 
[has heard enough] Okay.

PHILLIPS 
Sam...

SAM 
[shutting his portfolio] Thanks.

PHILLIPS 
No, it was an inappropriate...

SAM 
When I say 'okay,' that's it. Close your notebooks. We don't talk like that here. 
I don't give a damn whose nephew you are. Tommy, President Bartlet's not a candidate. 
He's the President.

Sam stands and leaves the men at the table.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

LEO 
What are the conditions inside the embassy?

NANCY 
It's still got running water but the power's been cut. The emergency generator's got 
about 24 hours.

LEO 
Any injuries?

MAN 
There aren't any injuries but the Deputy Chief's a diabetic and he's running out of 
insulin.

LEO 
The Red Cross can help us out there?

MAN 
Yes, sir.

LEO 
What's outside?

NANCY 
About 1200 troops now with A-15s positioned outside the gates. They've got four 105 
mm howitzers.

LEO 
Which are trained at?

The camera pans to the profile of Bartlet.

NANCY 
Our front door.

Church bells ring softly in the background as Bartlet drowns out Nancy's voice.

NANCY 
Mr. President, we want to send Fitzwallace down there.

BARTLET 
Why?

NANCY 
There's a Haitian general named Francis St. Jacques. He trained with Fitz at Annapolis...

SLOW FADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY
The bells get louder and we see a church on a bright day. A group of boys stand around 
talking as a number of other students walk around the school campus.

DR. BARTLET [OS] 
Jed! [beat] Jed!

BOY 
Jed, Jed, your father's calling you.

DR. BARTLET [OS]
Jed!

Young Jed Bartlet hears and runs to his father, who is standing with another man.

DR. BARTLET 
Didn't you hear me calling you?

JED 
No sir, I didn't. I was, uh, I didn't.

DR. BARTLET 
Mr. Spence found this cigarette butt on the floor in the aisle of the chapel.

JED 
People shouldn't put their cigarettes out in the chapel, Mr. Spence.

DR. BARTLET 
Well, people shouldn't be smoking in the chapel, I think is my point, Jed. Do you 
understand what I'm saying?

JED 
Yes, sir.

DR. BARTLET 
Could you tell your friends, please?

JED 
[turning to leave] Yeah.

DR. BARTLET 
Jed, hang on. I want you to meet someone. She's going to be taking over in my office for 
Mrs. Tillinghouse. 

He turns and gets the attention of a woman who is talking with a group of people.

DR. BARTLET
Excuse me! 

A young, pretty blonde turns.

DR. BARTLET
This is Delores Landingham. Mrs. Landingham, this is my eldest son, Jed.

Jed and Mrs. Landingham look at each other and smile.

LEO [VO] 
So what happens?

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - PRESENT
Bartlet listens, tapping an unlit cigarette on the table.

NANCY 
Basically we think we can get St. Jacques to fracture Bazan's army.

LEO 
So if we invade...?

NANCY 
It becomes peacekeeping.

Leo turns to look at Bartlet.

BARTLET 
Okay. Send Fitzwallace down. Anything else?

NANCY 
No, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.

They all stand. Bartlet exits and walks with Charlie. They go up the STAIRS.

BARTLET 
They've been in there 48 hours.

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir.

BARTLET 
The guy's been President of his country for two days. He's spent them both at gunpoint.

CHARLIE 
Yeah.

BARTLET 
What do you know about this storm?

CHARLIE 
The one...?

BARTLET 
It's moving from Florida to South Carolina.

CHARLIE 
Yeah. It's supposed to be bad.

BARTLET 
It's a tropical storm.

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir.

BARTLET 
No, I mean it's been designated a tropical storm. That means it has a surface wind 
speed of something.

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir.

BARTLET 
Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?

CHARLIE 
I'm not certain.

BARTLET 
I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.

CHARLIE 
I could have someone find out for you, Mr. President.

BARTLET 
I mean it's not a big deal. It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.

CHARLIE 
The Motorcade will leave for the cathedral in an hour.

BARTLET 
You ever been to National Cathedral?

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir.

BARTLET 
You know you could lay the Washington Monument down on its side in that church?

CHARLIE 
I did, actually.

They enter the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET 
We should try it.

CHARLIE 
You only have two meetings between now and then. Is there anything else you need, sir?

BARTLET 
[entering the Oval Office] I need pallbearers.

CHARLIE 
Yes, sir.

As Bartlet passes, the camera focuses in on Mrs. Landingham's desk, which has been left 
untouched. 

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY
C.J.'s image appears on a television screen at the back of the room. The room is filled 
with reporters. C.J. is standing behind the podium with Carol on her right. 

C.J.
Also in the combat radius will be six J-Socs out of McDill and a Battalion Landing Team. 
They'll cover that at the Pentagon briefing.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Yes.

WOMAN REPORTER
Does the fact that the OAS has passed a resolution allowing you to explore military 
options mean you've exhausted the diplomatic ones?

C.J.
Of course it doesn't, but it should underline the consequences for Bazan should he 
decide to enter our embassy and/or arrest the democratically elected President of 
Haiti. That's all I have for now. Thank you.

C.J. turns and leaves.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! C.J.!

Carol raises her hand to quiet the crowd and steps to the podium.
 
CAROL
Before you all go, C.J. needs to see AP, Reuters, and Agence France in the office. 
She needs to discuss seating arrangements on Air Force One.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. strides through the hall. Sam spots her and walks after her. They pedeconference 
as they talk.

SAM
C.J.

C.J.
Yeah.

SAM
We've got a problem.

C.J.
[sighs] That's pretty hard to believe.

SAM
We can't have the press conference in the East Room.

C.J.
What are you talking about?

SAM
I just got off the phone with Brian Coburn and we can't have it in the East Room.

C.J.
[alarmed] Why not?

SAM
They've been pulling the wiring and they found asbestos and they have to seal it off.

C.J.
[throws her hand up in the air, exasperated] There's been asbestos in the East Room 
this whole time?

SAM
Yeah. So I'm gonna make a list...

They reach a set of French doors leading to the JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. C.J. proceeds 
through the doors, but Sam stays behind in the hall. 

C.J.
[turns to look at Sam] Put together - okay - put together a list of alternatives.

SAM
Yeah.

C.J. walks briskly to her office. Carol, Steve, and the other two reporters, one of whom 
is a woman, are standing in the doorway to C.J.'S OFFICE, waiting for her. C.J. walks 
into her office and the reporters follow her.

C.J.
[to reporters] Come on in...

STEVE
C.J., I don't have any problem with my seat on the plane.

C.J.
[tersely] Get inside.

STEVE
Seriously, I complained that one time cause, I don't know, I was in a bad mood.

C.J. sets her briefing binder down on her desk.
 
C.J.
This isn't about seating arrangements. Notebooks, no tape recorders. This story's 
embargoed for an hour, and you'll identify me as a senior White House official.

C.J. closes the door.
 
CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Leo is leaning on the desk, while two advisors give him a briefing. Bartlet is standing 
off to one side, reading, only half listening.

LEO
Are we talking about the opening bell?

ADVISOR 1
That depends... uh... when's it gonna leak?

LEO
I'm sorry?

ADVISOR 1
When are we leaking the story?

LEO
C.J.'s doing it right now.

Bartlet removes his glasses and turns to listen. Leo checks his watch.

ADVISOR 1
Wall Street'll have it in an hour. In two hours, sellers will outnumber buyers.

One of the doors to the portico flies open. Bartlet and Leo both turn, slightly startled. 
An agent walks over to close the door.

BARTLET
Excuse me. Keep going.

Bartlet opens the door to the OUTER OFFICE. Charlie is standing near his desk.

LEO
In what sectors?

ADVISOR 2
In all sectors of the New York Stock Exchange...

BARTLET
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Do you have any idea why the door to the portico keeps swinging open? It's a little 
annoying.

CHARLIE
They're replacing the latch. It's swinging open from the wind.

BARTLET
[gesturing] But the door opens out.

CHARLIE
When the right sequence of doors are open in the building, there's a wind tunnel into 
the Oval Office.

BARTLET
[small smile] No kidding!

Charlie smiles at Bartlet, who walks back into the office, closing the door behind 
himself.
 
LEO
What about Europe and Japan?

ADVISOR 1
Well, Japan's gonna be up and trading by the time we go on TV.

BARTLET
Charlie says there's a wind tunnel created by something. They're fixing the latch.

Bartlet glances over toward the portico as he walks toward Leo and the advisors. 
Margaret steps into the Oval Office via the door to Leo's office.

MARGARET
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
[to Margaret] Is the motorcade ready?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

Everyone looks at Bartlet, who puts his glasses in his shirt pocket and sighs.

BARTLET
Okay. Well, we've got to go. I don't know what to say. Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can 
buy some tech stocks and jack up the price.

Leo walks toward the door to his office, where Margaret is waiting.

LEO
[to advisors] Keep me posted on the bellwethers, okay?

ADVISOR 1
Yeah.

ADVISOR 2
Thank you, Mr. President.

The advisors leave. Bartlet appears distracted and melancholy as he buttons his shirt 
cuffs.

LEO
[to Margaret] Is the First Lady meeting us in the car?

MARGARET
Yes. It's a non-denominational service.

Margaret goes back into Leo's office. Leo turns to look at Bartlet. Bartlet glances over 
at Leo.

BARTLET
What did she say?

LEO
She said the First Lady's meeting us in the car.

Bartlet doesn't acknowledge Leo's words. Bartlet turns his back and flips his suit 
jacket on over his head. 

CUT TO: INT. SCHOOL OFFICE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY
Young Jed Bartlet, with his back turned, flips his suit jacket on over his head. Young 
Mrs. Landingham is in her office, typing. Bartlet pulls a folder from a file cabinet in 
an adjacent office, then walks back into her office.

JED
It wasn't a non-denominational service.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Of course it was.

JED
It wouldn't have felt non-denominational if you were Jewish.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
It was a non-denominational Christian service.

JED
Attendance at chapel's required for every...

Mrs. Landingham stands up and pulls a binder from a cabinet near her desk. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[firmer] It was a non-denominational service.

JED
"Our Father" is not non-denominational. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Everyone says "Our Father."

Jed picks up another file from her desk and they both walk out of her office into the 
hallway. They pedeconference. 

JED
Catholics don't. Catholics don't say, "For thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, 
forever and ever." [shrugs] You know? I'm just saying. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[slightly amused] Why do you work here?

JED
I'm sorry?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Why do you work here after classes? I can't imagine that anyone in your family's on 
work-study.

JED
No, I-I get free tuition, so, you know, I guess it's a good idea to give something back.

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Why do you call your father "sir"?

JED
[chuckles softly] Is this gonna be a whole afternoon of questions?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Well, actually, you've been talking for quite some time.

JED 
I'm sorry. Am I boring you, Delores? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[demurely] "Mrs. Landingham," please!

They stop walking and face each other. 

JED
My father's the Headmaster. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[mystified] Yeah, but before he was your Headmaster, he was your father, right? 

JED
I don't wanna make the other guys feel uncomfortable.

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
So you call him "sir"?

JED
Yeah.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[still mystified] Oh. 

She walks away and Jed watches her go. 

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, DC STREET - PRESENT DAY
The repeated peals of sirens and the rumbling of motorcycles fill the air as the 
Presidential motorcade winds through downtown. The Presidential limousine is also 
accompanied by several police cars and black SUVs. 

CUT TO: INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Abbey are seated next to each other in the back seat. Bartlet, looking very 
preoccupied and melancholy, stares out the window on his side. Abbey stares straight 
ahead. The silence between them is deafening. After a few moments, Abbey turns slowly 
to look at him. 

ABBEY
[gently] You know, they released the girl from the hospital this morning. 

Bartlet acknowledges her words, but does not look at her. He barely turns his eyes from 
the window. 

BARTLET
The driver?

ABBEY
Yeah... She fractured her wrist, some stitches over her eye, and the other two had some 
scratches and bruises. [clears throat softly] It looks like they're gonna charge her 
with vehicular manslaughter.

Abbey looks over at him, but he doesn't respond. He just stares out the window. She 
looks away, somewhat discouraged, but trying to figure out another way to reach him. 

ABBEY
Frank Mitchell, Joanna... Bill Carney... they told me they were in meetings all morning.

BARTLET 
[absently] Yeah.
 
Abbey pauses and glances at him tentatively. When she does speak, her manner and the look 
on her face suggest that she doesn't fully agree with the viewpoint that she describes. 

ABBEY
The consensus seems to be that if you step back, and put your support behind Hoynes, 
there's a decent chance the Democrats can keep the White House.

Bartlet keeps staring out the window. After a long pause, he nods slightly. 

BARTLET
The world'll rest easier. 

Abbey seems a bit stunned by his response. She stares at him, wide eyed, for several 
moments, and then slowly looks away, resigned and sad. She looks almost like she's 
about to cry. 

BARTLET
We're here. 

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - DAY
It is a bright, spring day. The sky is blue and trees are blooming. The cathedral is 
enormous and quite beautiful. As the motorcade pulls up in front of the church, with 
sirens still blaring, the sound of an organ playing a processional fills the air. 

The Presidential limousine stops in front of the steps leading to the main entrance. 
Secret Service agents open the limousine doors for Bartlet and Abbey, who get out on 
opposite sides of the vehicle. Bartlet walks around the back of the limousine and looks 
up at the huge building with a mixture of weariness and sadness. Abbey walks up the 
steps by his side and gently takes his hand. He lets her take it but doesn't react. 
They walk inside. 

CUT TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS
The high arches of the cathedral are illuminated by a huge, multi-colored rose window. 
Almost all of the attendees are seated as several Secret Service agents and ushers guide 
Abbey and Bartlet to a pew in the front. Abbey sits down and Bartlet sits down beside 
her, exhaling as he sits, as if it takes considerable effort for him to do so. 
REVEREND MONOHAN is seated at the front of the cathedral, facing the congregants. Once 
Bartlet and Abbey are seated, Monohan stands up. He is accompanied to the pulpit by a 
layperson. Toby, C.J., and Charlie look on from their seats. 

MONOHAN
"I am the Resurrection and I am Life," says the Lord. "Whoever believes in Me shall live, 
even though he die." God of Mercy, You are the hope of sinners, the joy of saints. 
We pray for our sister Delores whose body we honor with Christian burial.

As Monohan speaks, the camera pans over the faces of Bartlet and Abbey, then Leo. Sam, 
Josh, and Toby are seated together. Margaret, Carol and Donna are seated together. 
Carol is crying. The rose window is illuminated by the daylight. 

MONOHAN
Give her happiness with Your saints, and raise up her body with the saints at the Last 
Day to be in Your presence forever... As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and that 
at the last, He will stand upon the Earth...

The camera lingers on a very somber Bartlet. He is staring straight ahead, like a statue, 
and only half listening to the service, as he drifts back in time. 

MONOHAN 
After my awaking, He will raise me up...

YOUNG MRS. LANDINGHAM [VO]
Jed?

MONOHAN
...and in my body, I shall see God...

YOUNG MRS. LANDINGHAM [VO]
Jed!

MONOHAN
...and I myself shall see, and my eyes behold, Him who is my friend... 

FADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY 
It's a sunny afternoon. Young Jed Bartlet is hosing down several sculls. Young Mrs. 
Landingham walks up beside him to catch his attention. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Jed.

Bartlet seems distracted, or perhaps he doesn't hear her. He continues his work. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Jed!

JED
[looks over, sees her, and smiles slightly] I'm trying to get through an honest day's 
work, Mrs. Landingham. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You missed a spot. 

JED
I didn't miss it. I just haven't gotten to it yet. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Okay.

JED
You have a habit of doing that, you know? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What's that?

JED
Telling me I'm doing something wrong before I've had a chance to do it at all.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[brightly] Well, that must be a little annoying. 

JED
Yeah. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I've got a project for you. 

JED
Really.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You can show the courage and the intellect and the leadership skills everyone talks 
about. 

JED
I'm a little busy right now hosing down the boats. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know the women who work at this school are paid less money than the men? 

JED
Sorry?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The women are paid less money than the men.

JED
No, I didn't know that. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You think your father does? 

FADE TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
Bartlet is still staring straight ahead as the service proceeds. Clearly, his mind 
is elsewhere.

MONOHAN
First reading will be from Mr. Charles Young, from the Book of Wisdom, Chapter III. 

Charlie walks slowly toward the pulpit, led by a layperson. 

FADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - A DIFFERENT DAY, AFTERNOON
The bells of the school chapel are ringing softly. Mrs. Landingham is waiting for Jed 
at the end of the school day. She spots him, reading while he walks, and gets his 
attention. They walk across the grounds as they talk.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'd like an opportunity to make my case.

JED
What are you doing here?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'm raising an issue.

JED
You've been raising this issue for a week now. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I can tell it's had quite an effect on you.

JED
Don't you have a husband? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What does that have to do with anything? 

JED
I'm saying, shouldn't you maybe go home when you're done with work? 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Shouldn't you be minding your own business? 

JED
I just thought, since you're minding everybody else's, you know... 

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
And what is that supposed to mean? 

JED
In my family, we don't talk about money. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
That's because you have money. 

JED 
[walking away] Numbers, Mrs. Landingham. 

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Excuse me?

JED
If you want to convince me of something, show me numbers! 

Jed walks away and Mrs. Landingham walks inside a school building, which is 
constructed of gray stone. 

FADE TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
The camera drifts across the gray stone walls of the cathedral. Charlie is standing at 
the pulpit, reading. 

CHARLIE
"But the souls of the virtuous are in the hands of God. No torment shall ever touch 
them." 

Bartlet is staring straight ahead. He looks very sad. 

CHARLIE
"In the eyes of the unwise, they did appear to die, but they are at peace. For though 
in the sight of others they were punished, their hope is full of immortality."

The camera looks down from high above the congregants. The cathedral is illuminated by 
the soft light filtering through the windows.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY 
As a black car pulls away, Mrs. Landingham approaches Jed's car, which won't start.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Your car won't start.

JED
Yes.

She leans in the window.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What's wrong with it?

JED
It's possibly the starter motor or fan belt.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Do you know anything about cars?

JED
No.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Then how do you know...

JED
Cause those are the two things I've heard of. [gets out]

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You fix your car and pretend you're not listening. I'm just gonna stand here and talk 
to you 'cause I know you are. 

JED
[lifts the hood] What could you possibly want now?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles] I've got numbers.

JED 
There's something abnormal about you. [leans under the hood to tinker]

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[reading] Florence Chadwick in the English Department has been here 13 years. She makes 
$5,900 a year. Mr. Hopkins in the English Department has been here 4 years fewer and 
makes $7,100.

JED
[walks around her] Is this really the best time for this?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You don't seem to be going anywhere. [follows him, reading] A female cook makes $3,200 
compared to a male electrician who makes $3,900...

DISSOLVE TO: INT. NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
The service continues.

CONGREGATION
[reading] ....peace. Wherever there is danger, let us sow love. Wherever there is 
injury... harm. And wherever there is doubt, let there be faith in you. Amen.

As music begins, Reverend Monohan leads Toby, Sam, Josh, Charlie and two other men 
towards the casket. Donna, Margaret and Carol look on in tears. Bartlet looks upset 
and deep in thought. The men hoist the casket onto their shoulders. Monohan leads 
the processional out. C.J. sheds a tear and bows her head as they pass. Bartlet is 
still lost in thought.

DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY 
Jed is trying to start his car. Mrs. Landingham is leaning on the hood with a steno pad.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[reading] ...gets $2,100. The nurse makes $3,100. 

Jed gives up on starting the car and gets out.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[reading] Mrs. Mueller gets paid an additional $200 a year to conduct the choir and band, 
while Mr. Ryan gets paid an additional $400 a year to coach the rowing team.

JED
Crew.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What?

JED
It's not rowing, It's crew. [fiddles under the hood] And Florence Chadwick is a married 
woman with no dependants and Mr. Hopkins has a family of four to support.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
If we paid people by according to how many children they have to support then Malcolm 
Bundy, the groundskeeper, would get triple what the Head Master gets.

JED
Mrs. Landingham...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know I'm right.

JED
Look, what....

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know I'm right. You've known it since I brought it up. You've known it since before 
that.

JED
What do you want me to do about it?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I want you to bring it up with your father.

JED
[looks at her] See. I'm not a woman and I don't work here.

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
The women who do are afraid for their jobs. If they bring it up, they're afraid for 
their jobs. What is it you're afraid of?

He looks confused for a moment.

JED 
Why do you talk to me like this?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
'Cause you've never had a big sister and you need one. 

They size each other up.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiling] Look at you. You're a boy king. You're a foot smarter than the smartest kid 
in the class. You're blessed with inspiration. You must know this by now. You must have 
sensed it. Look, if you think we're wrong... if you think Mr. Hopkins should honestly 
get paid more than Mrs. Chadwick, then I respect that. But if you think we're right and 
you won't speak up because you can't be bothered, then God, Jed, I don't even want to 
know you. Come inside. [walks off] I'll call Triple A.

He puts his hands in his pockets and watches her go.

JED
Mrs. Mueller gets half as much to teach music as Mr. Ryan gets to coach crew.

She turns back. Jed smiles and bounces on his heel.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles, victoriously] You're going to do it.

JED 
Well, I didn't say that.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, you did.

JED
When?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Just then. You stuck your hands in your pockets. You looked away and smiled.

He nervously takes his hands out of his pockets.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
That means you made up your mind.

JED
That doesn't mean anything.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, it does.

JED
I stuck my hands in my pockets!

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles] And looked away, and smiled. We're in.

She walks away. Jed smiles at her and closes the hood of the car.

CUT TO: INT. NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
Bartlet stands alone glaring at the altar. Most of the guests have left the church. 
Abbey, Leo and Secret Service agents are standing at the back of the sanctuary. 
Leo approaches Bartlet.

LEO
[sighs] It was a beautiful service I thought. 

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
[quietly] I thought it was a beautiful service. [smiles] She was a real dame, old 
friend. A real broad.

BARTLET
[nodding] Yeah.

LEO
[leans in close] We've gotta go back to the office now, sir.

BARTLET 
[nods] Yeah.

LEO
[quietly] We've got some decisions to make now.

Bartlet looks absently for a moment.

BARTLET
Leo, would you do me a favor?

LEO
Yeah?

BARTLET
[motions to the agents] Would you ask the agents to seal the cathedral for a minute?

Leo looks at him.

LEO
Yeah.

Leo walks towards the agents. As Bartlet waits, we hear the sound of several heavy 
doors closing. Bartlet turns back towards the altar.

BARTLET
[tired] You're a son of a bitch, you know that? 

He slowly walks up the center aisle.

BARTLET
She bought her first new car and you hit her with a drunk driver. What, was that 
supposed to be funny? "You can't conceive, nor can I, the appalling strangeness of the 
mercy of God," says Graham Greene. I don't know who's ass he was kissing there 'cause 
I think you're just vindictive. What was Josh Lyman? A warning shot? That was my son. 
What did I ever do to yours but praise his glory and praise his name? There's a 
tropical storm that's gaining speed and power. They say we haven't had a storm this 
bad since you took out that tender ship of mine in the north Atlantic last year... 
68 crew. You know what a tender ship does? Fixes the other ships. Doesn't even carry 
guns. Just goes around, fixes the other ships and delivers that mail. That's all it 
can do. [angry] Gratias tibi ago, domine. Yes, I lied. It was a sin. [holds out arms] 
I've committed many sins. Have I displeased you, you feckless thug? 3.8 million new 
jobs, that wasn't good? Bailed out Mexico, increased foreign trade, 30 million new 
acres of land for conservation, put Mendoza on the bench, we're not fighting a war, 
I've raised three children...

He ascends the stairs to the Inner Sanctuary.

BARTLET
[pleading] That's not enough to buy me out of the doghouse? Haec credam a deo pio? 
A deo iusto? A deo scito? 

He stops at the top of the stairs and extends his arms.

BARTLET 
Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci. [angry] 
Cruciatus in crucem. [waves dismissively] Eas in crucem!

Bartlet turns away in anger. He descends to the lower sanctuary and lights a cigarette. 
He takes a single puff, drops the butt to the floor, and grinds it defiantly with his 
shoe. He looks back at the altar.

BARTLET
[betrayed] You get Hoynes!

Bartlet holds back tears as he walks down the aisle.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
C.J., Sam, Toby and Josh sit. They all look drained and serious.

C.J.
We'll call them Answer A and Answer B.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Mr. President does this mean you won't be seeking a second term? Answer A is 'You bet. 
I will absolutely be seeking a second term. I'm looking forward to the campaign. There is 
great work that is yet to be done.'

Toby and Sam sit silently.

JOSH
Yes.

C.J. 
Answer B...

JOSH
'Are you out of your mind? I can't possibly win re-election. I lied about a degenerative 
illness. I'm the target of a Grand Jury investigation and Congress is about to take me 
out to lunch. I'd sooner have my family take their clothes off and dance the Tarantella 
on the Truman Balcony than go through a campaign with this around my neck.'

C.J. drinks water while she thinks.

JOSH 
You think that's too on the nose?

C.J. 
I do.

SAM
[looks down] I want to bring it up again.

C.J.
Why?

SAM
[angry] 'Cause I got shouted down the first three times and I work here just like you do. 
Can I help you?

C.J. stares at him for a moment.

C.J.
Sorry.

SAM
[starts pacing] I think we have to explore ways of calling this off.
 
TOBY
Sam...

SAM
I think it might be a mistake to send him on at a moment when we're trying to 
demonstrate...

TOBY
Listen...

SAM
[yelling] We don't know what the hell they're talking about in there, Toby. We don't 
know whether he's running or not! I think we have to...

TOBY
There are no ways. The story's leaked. It's out there. We're doing this. Don't worry, 
it's going to be fine. 

He gets up and walks towards his desk.

TOBY
[sarcastic] They're lighting him from outside the window.

Ginger opens the door.

GINGER
Toby...

TOBY
[sighs] I have a meeting with Greg Summerhays for reasons past understanding.

Sam leaves quickly. C.J. and Josh follow him out. GREG SUMMERHAYS enters.

TOBY
Hello.

GREG SUMMERHAYS
Toby.

Summerhays closes the door behind him.

SUMMERHAYS
It's good to see you.

They shake hands.

TOBY
Good Morning, Greg.

SUMMERHAYS
I was sorry about the, uh, President's secretary.

TOBY
Thank you.

SUMMERHAYS
Did you know her well?

TOBY
Yeah.

Summerhays looks around uncomfortably.

SUMMERHAYS
Let me get to why I'm here. I want to...

TOBY
You want to buy Atlantic Intermediate.

They sit down.

SUMMERHAYS
[nodding] Yeah.

TOBY
Greg, there's a reason the FCC...

SUMMERHAYS
I'm not here about the FCC.

TOBY
[surprised] Why are you here?

SUMMERHAYS
[leans forward] I'm launching a 24-hour cable news channel and I'm building it to 
compete. 

Toby looks surprised.

SUMMERHAYS
And I'd like you to be the news director.

Toby tries to bite back his anger.

TOBY
Okay. Thanks for coming in. Excuse me.

Toby storms out.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh aimlessly wanders around his desk, shuffling through files. Donna enters.

DONNA
It was a nice service, don't you think?

Josh looks at her for a moment.

JOSH
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

DONNA
I'm gonna run across the street to the OEOB for a minute. The President is still after 
information on the storm. I'm not sure why he's got it in his teeth.

Josh shuffles through papers quietly.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA 
Josh, can this really be how it works?

He looks at her.

DONNA
We have no idea if he's gonna run again. He's in a room with Leo making a decision. 
Two people in a matter of minutes. This is how it works?

The phone rings.

JOSH
[tired] This is how it works today.

Josh wanders over to the credenza and shuffles absently through the papers. Donna answers 
the phone.

DONNA 
[into phone] Josh Lyman. [to Josh] It's Leo.

Josh turns and looks at the phone.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Toby storms through.

STAFFER
Hey, Toby!

Toby lifts his hand in warning.

TOBY
[angry] Don't anybody talk to me right now.

He heads for JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh is on the phone.

TOBY
Josh, Greg Summerhays was here to offer me a job. [yelling] Leo got me a damned lifeboat!

Josh hangs up.

TOBY
[yelling] I'm gonna rip his arms off...

Josh turns towards Toby.

JOSH
[quietly] Toby...

TOBY
[yelling]...and beat him with his own...

JOSH
[quietly] That was Leo. He wants us over there. It's answer B.

Donna follows Josh out. Toby stands stunned for a moment then leaves. He follows Josh 
and Donna down the hall.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

NEWSCASTER [VO] 
...With the President and First Lady having just concluded the interview...

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The T.V.s on the stand are tuned to the same program. The sounds of roaring thunder 
are heard.

NEWSCASTER [on T.V.]
...President Bartlet is expected to be arriving at the State Department for a press 
conference. Typically, a press conference, particularly this size, would be held in 
the East Room of the White House, but we're told there's some repairs going on there, 
so the change of venue. Chris Watson, can you tell us what we might expect to hear 
from the President in a few minutes? [fumbles with his earpiece] Wait... all right. 
Our apologies, we'll have Chris in a moment. Let's go to...

CUT TO: INT. THE LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo and Bartlet are walking inside. An agent stands outside.

LEO [gently]
Why don't you sit in here for a few minutes?

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
I'm gonna get C.J., you two do a last minute review.

BARTLET
I'm fine.

LEO
I'm gonna get C.J.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO 
[very gently] Sit here. Close your eyes a few minutes. Charlie will get you when 
we're ready.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Bartlet sits down on a chair facing the window. Leo exits and closes the door behind 
him.

BARTLET [VO]
...A couple of years ago, I began experiencing blurred vision and numbness in my legs. 
Two years and many tests later...

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet is shown on the monitors, sitting with Abbey.

BARTLET [on T.V.] 
...I was diagnosed with a course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Toby is watching the television. Leo approaches him.

MAN [on T.V.] 
That startling admission made just moments ago by President Bartlet...

LEO
Toby...

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Where's C.J.?

TOBY
She ran back to her office. 

Leo looks at the television.

TOBY
They're gonna run this clip forever.

LEO
No, we're about to give them clips to beat it.

TOBY
Leo, you got me a lifeboat?

LEO
Greg Summerhays.

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Yeah, I got you a lifeboat.

TOBY
Did you imagine there are any circumstances under which I would use it?

LEO
No.

TOBY
Then why?

LEO
To show him that.

Leo heads for the door, stops and turns to Toby.

LEO
C.J.'s in her office?

TOBY
You think he's gonna change his mind, don't you? 

LEO
Hmm?

TOBY
You think he's gonna run?

LEO
C.J.'s in her office?

TOBY
Yeah.

Leo leaves.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The President is standing by the window looking out at the rain. There's a knock on 
the door.

BARTLET
Yeah!

MARGARET 
[enters, stands before him] Mr. President, you wanted to see Donna Moss?

BARTLET
Yeah.

Donna walks in. Margaret leaves.

DONNA
Good evening, sir.

BARTLET
How are you?

DONNA
Fine, thank you, sir. We all thought you did very well.

BARTLET
That was the easy part.

DONNA
It didn't look that easy.

BARTLET 
[as they sit facing each other] Talk about the weather.

DONNA 
[clears throat softly] A tropical storm is a cyclone in which the maximum sustained 
surface speed of the wind is 34 nautical miles per hour.

BARTLET
And there's a tropical storm seizing, right?

DONNA
Yes, sir, it's June 1st to November 30th.

BARTLET
Okay, and how many times say, in the last hundred years, has a tropical storm come off 
the Atlantic seaboard to Washington in the middle of May?

DONNA
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it hasn't happened in 
the last century.

BARTLET
At all?

DONNA
No, sir.

Knocking on the door. Donna stands up apprehensively. C.J. enters.

C.J.
Excuse me, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah. Thanks, Donna.

DONNA
Thank you, Mr. President. [exits]

BARTLET
According to the NOAA, the storm is a non-recurring phenomenon, which is science's term 
for 'we don't know what in the world is going on, but we're stocking up on canned goods.'

C.J.
I just wanted to review a few things.

BARTLET
Is this stuff you don't think I'd remember from an hour ago?

C.J.
You'll want to take the first question from Lawrence Altman, the Times' Chief Medical 
Correspondent.

BARTLET
Why?

C.J.
Because if you call on anyone else, the first question will be about reelection. Call 
on Altman, it will be a medical question, and it'll have two or three follow-ups. 
It'll allow you to feel comfortable a little before you start with the political mess.

BARTLET
Okay.

C.J.
Altman will be in the front row, first seat on your right.

BARTLET
Okay. [walks away and looks aside]

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

C.J.
Where's Altman going to be?

BARTLET
C.J....

C.J.
Mr. President, I'm going there right now. This is the last time I'm going to see you 
before you step up... please, where's...?

BARTLET
Front row, first seat on the right.

C.J.
Whose right?

BARTLET
My right.

C.J.
Thank you, sir. [exits]

Thunder roaring. Bartlet hears knocking.

CUT TO: INT. THE BARTLET RESIDENCE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - NIGHT
Young Jed is knocking on his father's office door - once, twice, three times.

DR. BARTLET [VO] 
Come in. 

Dr. Bartlet is sitting in an armchair reading a newspaper, as Jed enters and approaches 
the other chair.

DR. BARTLET 
[reading] "If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn." 
Is this your quote?

JED
Dad, uh, I wanted to mention something to you that maybe you weren't aware of regarding 
salary acquisitions...

DR. BARTLET
Is this your quote? "If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never 
learn."

JED
It's actually Ray Bradbury.

DR. BARTLET
And you quoted Ray Bradbury?

JED
Yes.

DR. BARTLET
In an article you and your friends wrote, condemning professor Loomis.

JED 
[sits] For banning certain books from the library, yes.

DR. BARTLET
He is a professor of literature.

JED
He banned Henry Miller. He banned D.H. Lawrence.

DR. BARTLET
Yes.

JED
"Giovanni's Room" 'cause it's too homosexual!

DR. BARTLET
Stop it right now. You're a guest at this school.

JED
I'm a student at this school.

DR. BARTLET
Jed!

JED
He banned "Fahrenheit 451," which is about banning books!

DR. BARTLET
Was that supposed to be funny? 

He stands, Jed stands after him.

DR. BARTLET
That wordplay you just did there, was that meant to be funny?

JED
That was supposed...

Dr. Bartlet slaps him across the face.

DR. BARTLET
Was there anything else?

JED 
[quetly, looking away] It's not a nondenominational service.

DR. BARTLET
Don't start with this. [walks over to his desk]

JED
Catholics don't believe man is saved through faith alone. Catholics believe that faith 
has to be joined with good works.

DR. BARTLET
You're the only one who seems to mind the service.

JED
I'm the only one who's Catholic.

DR. BARTLET
You're Catholic because your mother is, and you're at the school because I'm the 
headmaster. How's that for clever with words? [sits down] But what was it you came in 
here to talk to me about?

JED
Nothing.

DR. BARTLET
Please close the door behind you.

Jed shuts the door to his father's office. 

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
President Bartlet closes the door behind C.J. in THE OVAL OFFICE. Thunder roars. 
Bartlet walks to lean on his desk and places his hands among the many pictures on it. 
Suddenly, the wind blows the portico door wide open and rain pours in.

BARTLET
Ah... Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!

He turns away, realizing she won't come to his call, and then the door opens...

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
[walks in, small and resolute] I really wish you wouldn't shout, Mr. President.

BARTLET 
[beat, as he looks at her in disbelief] The door keeps blowing open.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, but there's an intercom and you could use it to call me at my desk.

BARTLET
I was...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You don't know how to use the intercom.

BARTLET
It's not that I don't know how to use it, it's just that I haven't learned yet. 

She looks at him and he smiles shyly, as if he's been caught lying.

BARTLET
I have M.S., and I didn't tell anybody.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah. So, you're having a little bit of a day.

BARTLET
You're gonna make jokes?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
God doesn't make cars crash, and you know it. Stop using me as an excuse.

BARTLET 
[motions her to sit and sits down] The party's not going to want me to run.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The party'll come back. You'll get them back.

BARTLET
I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham. I've never been the most popular guy in the 
Democratic Party.

MRS. LANDINGHAM 
[sits opposite from him] I've got a secret for you, Mr. President your father was a 
prick who could never get over the fact that he wasn't as smart as his brothers. Are 
you in a tough spot? Yes. Do I feel sorry for you? I do not. Why? Because there are 
people way worse off than you.

BARTLET
Give me numbers.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I don't know numbers. You give them to me.

BARTLET
How about a child born this minute has a one in five chance of being born into poverty?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How many Americans don't have health insurance?

BARTLET
44 million.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What's the number one cause of death for black men under 35?

BARTLET
Homicide.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How many Americans are behind bars?

BARTLET
Three million.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How many Americans are drug addicts?

BARTLET
Five million.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
And one of five kids in poverty?

BARTLET
That's 13 million American children.

From a shot up top, we see President Bartlet is talking, and the opposite chair is empty.

BARTLET
Three and a half million kids go to schools that are literally falling apart. We need 
127 billion in school construction, and we need it today!

MRS. LANDINGHAM
To say nothing of 53 people trapped in an embassy.

BARTLET
Yes.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know, if you don't want to run again, I respect that. [stands up] But if you don't 
run 'cause you think it's gonna be too hard or you think you're gonna lose... well, God, 
Jed, I don't even want to know you.

Mrs. Landingham walks out and gently closes the Oval Office door behind her. President 
Bartlet stands, walks into the open door onto the portico and lets the wind blow on him 
and the rain wash over his face. He looks up into the sky. Music starts.

CHARLIE [OS] 
Mr. President! 

Charlie appears with a coat that he's holding unwrapped.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, it's time.

Bartlet avoids the coat and walks into another door. Charlie follows him. At his desk, 
he leaves the coat and takes off his own as well. Bartlet keeps walking to the HALLWAYS 
while his agents follow him.

The song 'Brothers in Arms' by Dire Straits plays softly.


	These mist covered mountains
	Are a home now for me,
	But my home is the lowlands
	And always will be.


Leo joins the President walking.	


	Some day you'll return to
	Your valleys and your farms
	And you'll no longer burn
	To be brothers in arms...


Josh, Sam and Toby follow.

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
C.J. is on the podium in front of a filled room.

C.J.
And he'll be speaking to that just as soon as he gets here.

All the reporters clamor for C.J.

C.J.
Uh, Frank, then Leslie.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
Bartlet walks around his limousine.


	Through these fields of destruction,
	Baptisms of fire,
	I've witnessed your suffering
	As the battles raged higher.


CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 

FRANK
Has there been any discussion of a Special Prosecutor?

C.J.
Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General appoint a Special 
Prosecutor, yes.

Reporters clamor again.

C.J.
I can't see. Joan!


	And though they did hurt me so bad
	In the fear and alarm,
	You did not desert me,
	My brothers in arms...


CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
The limo is driving in the rain, guards all around it. Inside, Leo looks at Bartlet 
worriedly. Bartlet just stares ahead.

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
A list of three prosecutors is given to a three-judge panel. The prosecutors, as well 
as the judges, were all appointed by Republican presidents. 

Reporters clamor, as Donna and Margaret, pale and dressed in coats, tear through the 
crowd and stand at a distance.

C.J.
Please, I can only answer 14 or 15 questions at once. Hal!

CUT TO: INT. NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS
A janitor is washing the floor and stumbles upon a cigarette. He lifts it and looks 
outside as sirens announce the President's passing. Limos and lights are seen through 
open doors of the Cathedral. 


	There's so many different worlds,
	So many different suns,
	And we have just one world
	But we live in different ones...


As his limo passes by, Bartlet glances at the Cathedral.

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
 
C.J.
I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, but I imagine subpoenas will be 
issued to most Senior White House Staff including myself.

Reporters clamor.

CUT TO: EXT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
The motorcade arrives in the rain. An agent runs and opens the limo door. The President 
comes out and looks up as thunder rumbles and lightning flashes. He slowly walks inside.
Everyone follows him. No umbrellas are in sight.


	Now the sun's gone to hell
	And the moon's riding high,


Bartlet is given a towel and he wipes his face with it, as he, followed by Charlie, Leo, 
Toby, Sam, Josh, and several Secret Service agents, heads for the conference room.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS CONFERENCE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearings Congress has in mind. I'm sure there'll 
be one but you'd have to talk to Congress.


	Let me bid you farewell...


Carol gives her a slight nod as she spots the President approaching.

C.J.
Okay, here now, the President of the United States. 


	Every man has to die...


Everyone stands in silence as Bartlet walks up to the podium. He passes C.J.

C.J.
[quietly] Front row on your right.


	But it's written in the starlight
	And every line on your palm
	We're fools to make war
	On our brothers in arms...


Bartlet looks over the room. He sees Lawrence Altman, waiting to be called.
Instead, he points to the center of the room.

BARTLET 
Yes, Sandy.

C.J. watches in shock.

SANDY 
Mr. President, can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?

BARTLET
I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a bit of noise there, could you repeat the question?

SANDY 
Can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?

Charlie, C.J., Josh and Sam, Donna and Margaret, and Toby all watch. Leo turns away 
from the monitor.

LEO
Watch this...

In the midst of thunder and lightning, they are all waiting, watching, as Bartlet 
slides his hands off the podium, puts them in his pockets, looks away and smiles.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
